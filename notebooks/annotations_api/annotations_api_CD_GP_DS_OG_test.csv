PMC3897916,UNK,"A substantial number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatments (TF-CBT) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (for reviews see Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, 2007; Bisson et al., 2007; Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra, & Westen, 2005; Kitchner, Roberts, Wilcox, & Bisson, 2012; Powers, Halpern, Ferenschak, Gillihan, & Foa, 2010; Stein et al., 2009).

PMC3897916,UNK,These RCTs have shown very large effect sizes in treating PTSD symptoms and associated symptoms of depression and anxiety for a range of TF-CBT programs. ,"[['ociated symptoms of depression and anxiety for a r', 'depression', 'Diseases'], ['s of depression and anxiety for a range of TF-C', 'anxiety', 'Diseases']]","[[99, 109, 'depression', 'DS'], [114, 121, 'anxiety', 'DS']]"
PMC3897916,UNK,There is as yet less evidence on how effective such treatment programs are when applied in routine clinical settings. ,,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,Clinicians are often concerned that that the good outcomes observed in RCTs may not generalize to the wide range of traumas and presentations seen in clinical practice. ,,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,Do the effects of TF-CBT programs generalize to routine clinical care? ,,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,Several factors are conceivable that could potentially limit the extent to which the treatment effects observed in RCTs generalize to patients seen in routine clinical practice. ,,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"Although most RCTs studied clinically pertinent samples with moderate to severe PTSD and associated comorbid conditions, they applied certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. ",,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"The selection may influence outcome, for example, by increasing the average size of improvement by requiring a minimum severity or by excluding difficult-to-treat patients. ",,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"One of these potential factors is that many RCTs selected patients who suffered from discrete traumas such as physical or sexual assault or traffic accidents (but may have also experienced additional other traumas, e.g., Bryant, Moulds, Guthrie, Dang, & Nixon, 2003; Ehlers et al., 2003; Foa et al., 2005; Resick, Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002; Schnurr et al, 2007), whereas in clinical practice patients may require treatment for wider range of traumas including prolonged and multiple traumatic events.

PMC3897916,UNK,"It remains unclear whether the exclusion of certain demographic groups such as men, people older than 65 years of age, or comorbid conditions such as borderline personality disorder influences the overall treatment effects. ","[[' conditions such as borderline personality disorder influences the over', 'borderline personality disorder', 'Diseases']]","[[150, 181, 'borderline personality disorder', 'DS']]"
PMC3897916,UNK,"Second, there have been concerns about a possible risk of symptom exacerbation with exposure to trauma memories (e.g., Tarrier et al., 1999). ","[['on with exposure to trauma memories (e.g., Tar', 'trauma', 'Diseases'], [' exposure to trauma memories (e.g., Tarrier et\xa0', 'memories', 'Gene Ontology']]","[[96, 102, 'trauma', 'DS']]"
PMC3897916,UNK,"Although initial reports have found symptom exacerbation to be uncommon in RCT samples (e.g., Foa, Zoellner, Feeny, Hembree, & Alvarez-Conrad, 2002; Hackmann, Ehlers, Speckens, & Clark, 2004), clinicians may be concerned that this problem may be more common in patients seen in routine clinical care. ","[[' RCT samples (e.g., Foa, Zoellner, Feeny, H', 'Foa', 'Organisms']]","[[94, 97, 'Foa', 'OG']]"
PMC3897916,UNK,A third concern relates to treatment dropouts. ,,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,Many of the earlier RCTs reported completer-only analyses. ,,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"If dropout rates are substantial, completer analyses may overestimate the efficacy of treatments. ",,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"Some RCTs have observed high dropout rates of between 25 and 43% with trauma-focused PTSD treatments in RCTs (e.g., Foa et al., 2005; Power et al., 2002; Resick et al., 2002; Schnurr et al, 2007), although the average dropout rate may not be higher than for other PTSD treatments (Hembree et al., 2003).

PMC3897916,UNK,"Fourth, in RCTs treatment is usually delivered by therapists who receive specialized training and supervision in TF-CBT, and clinicians with less training and supervision may find it difficult to replicate their results. ",,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"Thus, there is a need to empirically investigate how well the excellent outcomes of TF-CBT observed in RCTs can be replicated in routine clinical settings where patients are not selected for RCT suitability and treatment is delivered by therapists with a range of prior experience with TF-CBT. ",,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"Preliminary evidence suggests that TF-CBT programs can be successfully implemented in routine clinical services (for reviews see Cohen & Mannarino, 2008; Stewart & Chambless, 2009).

PMC3897916,UNK,(2010) reported large improvements in outreach programs for survivors of 9/11 and the London bombings who suffered from PTSD. ,,[]
PMC3897916,UNK,"Gillespie, Duffy, Hackmann, and Clark (2002) trained therapists from a range of professional backgrounds in Cognitive Therapy for PTSD, a version of TF-CBT that builds on Ehlers and Clark's (2000) model of PTSD. ",,[]

PMC3897916,UNK,"Whilst these initial studies evaluating the effectiveness of TF-CBT for PTSD are promising, they are limited in number, and further studies of larger samples of unselected patients with PTSD following the wide range of traumatic events seen in clinical settings are needed to determine the effectiveness of TF-CBT programs.

PMC3897916,DISCUSS,Treatment was well tolerated. ,,[]
PMC3897916,DISCUSS,"The overall dropout rate of 13.9% was low, despite the fact that the clinic served a catchment area characterized by high social deprivation and high mobility and that some of the therapists were inexperienced in delivering the treatment. ",,[]

PMC3585192,INTRO,"Smoking is the leading cause of death in high income countries such as Canada [1] and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cancer.

[5] About 50% of smokers die of smoking-related diseases and smokers who die between the ages of 35 and 69 in Canada lose on average more than 20 years of life.[6]–[8] Importantly, however, smoking cessation can reverse the risk for mortality; quitting by age 50 can halve the lifetime risk, while quitting by age 30 can reduce the risk close to that of never smokers.

PMC3585192,INTRO,Previous studies have indicated that the distribution of smoking is not uniform across the Canadian population. ,,[]
PMC3585192,INTRO,"Geographically, rates of smoking vary considerably, with a higher prevalence of current smoking generally found in the Eastern and Atlantic provinces compared to Ontario and British Columbia. [12] In addition, smoking has consistently been found to be concentrated among individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) in Canada [13] and other high income countries[14]–[16]; while higher SES has been related to increased smoking cessation.[17]–[20] For example, evidence from the National Population Health Survey in Canada indicated that high levels of education and household income were associated with quitting over a two year period in men and women. [21] Despite these important findings, many questions remain including: to what extent are socioeconomic differences a source of variation in current smoking and quitting across provinces?

","[['e from the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Surv', 'Tobacco', 'Organisms']]","[[31, 38, 'Tobacco', 'OG']]"
PMC3585192,METHODS,"CTUMS was conducted by Statistics Canada on behalf of Health Canada to provide nationally representative data on tobacco use and related issues in Canada. [22] CTUMS covered all persons in Canada aged 15 and older except for residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and those living in long-term care institutions or Canadian Forces bases. ","[['resentative data on tobacco use and related iss', 'tobacco', 'Organisms']]","[[113, 120, 'tobacco', 'OG']]"
PMC3585192,METHODS,"The sampling frame only included land line telephone numbers, thus excluding people without telephone land lines (about 16% of the target population). [22] The sampling weights provided with CTUMS have been adjusted to account for these individuals. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Survey Design ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"A stratified two-stage sampling strategy was used in the CTUMS. [22] In each of the ten provinces, geographic strata were defined according to a census metropolitan area (CMA) stratum and a non-CMA stratum. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"CMAs are census defined areas corresponding to cities and urban areas with populations of 100,000 or more. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"In Prince Edward Island, only 1 geographic stratum was defined, and in Ontario and Quebec, a third stratum was defined for Toronto and Montreal, respectively. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,The CTUMS sampling frame was a list of in-service telephone prefixes (3 digit area code+next 5 digits) compiled from telephone company files within each of the province-stratum combinations. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"In the first stage, telephone prefixes were systematically sampled within each stratum and a random 2-digit number was appended to the prefix to form a complete telephone number. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Known business and not-in-service telephone numbers were then screened and removed from the sample prior to dialing. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"In the second stage, and in order to increase the number of respondents in the 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 age groups, one or two individuals (or none) were selected to participate in the survey based on the age composition of the household. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Sampling weights were provided with the CTUMS in order to adjust estimates for non-response, household composition, and an external adjustment to national population estimates from the Canadian census. [22] The household response rate (defined as the proportion of households who were reached and provided ages of all household members) was 73.8% for both cycles of the CTUMS from February to December 2010, and the individual response rate was 84.2%. [23]. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Interviews for CTUMS were conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"The CATI application was employed in conjunction with extensive interviewer training in order to minimize data collection errors. [23] In total CTUMS collected information from 19,822 respondents aged 15–85 years in ten Canadian provinces. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"All respondents had complete information on current smoking status, age, gender, and province of residence. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Respondents with incomplete information for any of the other independent variables (marital status, occupation, or education) were excluded (n = 439, 2.2%). ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,An examination of the basic demographic characteristics between complete and partial respondents did not reveal any substantive differences. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"The final sample for analysis was 19,383. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Outcome ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Categories of smoking behaviour at the time of survey were defined as follows: current cigarette smokers were individuals who had smoked 100 or more cigarettes in their lifetime and reported smoking daily or occasionally during the past 30 days. ,"[['tegories of smoking behaviour at the time of surv', 'behaviour', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Former smokers had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and reported having quit and did not smoke any cigarettes in the 30 days prior to the survey. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Never smokers were lifelong never smokers (<100 cigarettes smoked in their lifetime). ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"For these analyses, quitting was defined as the proportion of former smokers relative to ever smokers (current and former smokers). [24] Overall in the CTUMS sample, the weighted prevalence of current smoking was 16.57%; 26.6% were former smokers, and 56.8% were never smokers. ",,[]

PMC3585192,METHODS,"We considered age, sex, and marital status as demographic characteristics. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Age was grouped into the following categories: 15–19, 20–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+ years for descriptive analyses, and centred about its weighted mean (45 years) and treated as a continuous measure in regression models. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"In addition, polynomial terms were included for age to allow for the assessment of non-linearity. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Sex was based on self-report. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Marital status was categorized as common-law/married, single, or widowed/divorced/separated (reference: married). ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Socioeconomic status was measured by education and occupation. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Education was grouped into four categories based on the highest level completed: less than secondary school, completed secondary, completed post-secondary/college, and completed university (reference: completed university). ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Occupational categories were adapted from the 2006 National Occupational Classification for Statistics (NOC-S) [25], and included professional specialties, executive or managerial positions, sales/service positions, and manual occupations (including trades, transport, industry, manufacturing, and utilities). ","[[' (including trades, transport, industry, manufact', 'transport', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Additional categories were specified for individuals not currently working and for respondents who did not report their occupation and professionals were taken as the reference category. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Geographic location was defined as province of residence at the time of survey and verified by telephone company administrative files. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Statistical Analysis ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"We used logistic regression to model current smoking (current smokers vs never smokers) and quitting (former smokers vs current smokers) conditional on age, sex, marital status, education, occupation, and province. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Province of residence was ‘dummy’ coded and treated as a fixed classification in these models. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"To examine potential differences in smoking patterns between men and women, interaction effects were considered between sex and age, sex and education, and sex and occupation. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,Adjusted prevalence estimates were calculated for each independent variable separately while keeping the remaining independent variables at their mean values and expressed as a percent from 0.0 to 100.0. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Next, models were extended by including a random effect for province and specifying two-level multilevel models. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"The multilevel modeling strategy is described below, using the example of current smoking. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Two-level models were specified with a binary response (y, current smoking vs never smoking) for individual i in province j. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Current smoking Pr(yij = 1), was assumed to be binomially distributed  with probability  related to the set of independent variables  and a random effect for each level by a logit link function:(1) ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,The right hand side of Equation 2 consists of the fixed part linear predictor () and random intercepts for provinces (). ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,The intercept and the -coefficients are interpreted as before in Equation 1. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,The set of independent variables remained consistent between models although the indicator variables for provinces were included in the random part of Equation 2 (). ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"In this model, the random intercepts for provinces were assumed to be independently and identically distributed with variance . [26] The variance parameter quantifies heterogeneity in the log odds of smoking between provinces. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,We expressed the provincial-level variance as a percentage of the total variance from an initial model without covariates and from a final model accounting for all covariates. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"In order to examine the consistency of provincial variation in current smoking and quitting by SES (defined by education and occupation) and to determine whether the SES-smoking and SES-quitting associations varied across provinces in terms of strength or direction, we expanded Equation 1 to allow the slope for SES to vary across provinces:(2) ","[['ing and quitting by SES (defined by educati', 'SES', 'Gene_Proteins'], ['termine whether the SES-smoking and SES-qui', 'SES', 'Gene_Proteins'], ['allow the slope for SES to vary across prov', 'SES', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[95, 98, 'SES', 'GP']]"
PMC3585192,METHODS,"The key feature of Equation 2 is that the effect of education on smoking in province j consists of the overall average effect across all provinces (), plus a province-specific () differential in this effect. ",,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,We summarized this model by presenting the odds ratio for current smoking and quitting overall in Canada and for each province given a 1-category increase in education and occupation. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,The sampling weights provided with the CTUMS were used in all analyses. ,,[]
PMC3585192,METHODS,"Logistic regression models were estimated with Stata (version 12.1) [27], [28] and multilevel models were estimated with MLwiN (version 2.26) using the second order penalized quasi likelihood (PQL) procedure. [29]. ",,[]
PMC3585192,RESULTS,Results ,,[]
PMC3585192,RESULTS,"In the 2010 CTUMS, the prevalence (adjusted for age, sex, marital status, occupation, education, and province) for current smoking among Canadians 15 years of age and older was 20.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.8–21.7) and 63.7% (95% CI: 61.1–66.3) for quitting. ",,[]
PMC3585192,RESULTS,"At the provincial level, current smoking varied from 17.9% in British Columbia to 26.1% in Nova Scotia ( Figure 1 ), and quitting varied from 57.4% in Nova Scotia to 67.8% in Prince Edward Island ( Figure 2 ).

PMC3585192,RESULTS,Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for current smoking and quitting from the mutually adjusted logistic regression models are presented in  Table 2 . ,,[]
PMC3585192,RESULTS,The relationship between current regular smoking and age was strongly non-linear and this was emphasized by the statistical significance of the quadratic and cubic terms (P<0.001). ,,[]
PMC3585192,RESULTS,This relationship had an inverse-U shape with a peak smoking prevalence found between the ages of 35 and 40 years. ,,[]
PMC3585192,RESULTS,"The prevalence increased rapidly at younger ages; it was 8.6% at age 15 and 27.8% at age 30, equivalent to a 3.3-fold increase (95% CI: 2.0–5.5). ",,[]

PMC3585192,DISCUSS,Discussion ,,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,This paper has four principal findings. ,,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"First, current smoking in Canada was strongly influenced by socioeconomic status; people who had not completed secondary level education were more than three times as likely to smoke compared to those who had completed university. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Second, geographic analyses revealed that the adjusted prevalence of current smoking was statistically significantly lower than the Canadian average in three provinces: British Columbia, Ontario, and to a lesser extent, Prince Edward Island. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,This finding was consistent when provinces were treated as a fixed classification and as a random classification in a multilevel model. ,,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"In addition, the relationships between education and current smoking and between occupation and current smoking were consistent, negative, and statistically significant across all provinces in Canada. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Third, although roughly six out of ten Canadians who had ever smoked had quit, quitting was more likely to occur among those of higher socioeconomic status. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Geographically, large differences in quit rates were found between provinces, although the magnitude of difference was attenuated when province was treated as a random classification using a multilevel model. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Forth, although the associations between education and quitting and between occupation and quitting were positive in all provinces, some heterogeneity in the magnitude was found, especially in the education-quitting relationship which was noticeably steeper in British Columbia and shallower in Nova Scotia compared to the national average. ","[['ia and shallower in Nova Scotia compared to ', 'Nova', 'Chemicals'], ['d shallower in Nova Scotia compared to the nat', 'Scotia', 'Organisms']]","[[300, 306, 'Scotia', 'OG'], [295, 299, 'Nova', 'CD']]"
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,There are some limitations in this work. ,,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"First, the CTUMS data are cross-sectional therefore causal inferences from our findings must be interpreted cautiously. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"The primary motivation for this study, however, was to investigate variability in smoking behaviour across socioeconomic and geographic dimensions and such a design is appropriate. ","[['iability in smoking behaviour across socioeconomi', 'behaviour', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Second, the data are from a telephone survey, which as a design has several inherent potential sources of bias in terms of population coverage. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"For example, one limitation of telephone sampling is that some individuals either do not have telephones or have only a mobile phone, which were not part of the random telephone prefix sampling frames in the CTUMS. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Estimates from the 2010 Residential Telephone Service Survey suggest that 14–16% of the Canadian population do not have a landline and that these individuals are concentrated among those of 18–34 years of age and with below-average income. [30] Although efforts were made to weight the CTUMS survey data for individuals without land lines, it is conceivable that some of the prevalence estimates may be biased downwards given that our findings suggest smoking to be higher among these ages and lower SES groups. ","[['her among these ages and lower SES groups. ', 'SES', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[500, 503, 'SES', 'GP']]"
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"In addition, telephone surveys can produce a potential reporting bias among younger respondents who may be prone to give socially desirable answers about their smoking habits in the presence of their parents or family. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Estimates of youth smoking among 15–19 year olds in the CTUMS were lower than what has been reported among 16–19 year olds the UK (12% vs 24%) [31], although the CTUMS data for youth smoking have demonstrated good concordance with other prevalence estimates in Canada from general health surveys such as the Canadian Community Heath Survey, which uses a combination of in-person and telephone-based interviews.[32]–[34] Second, we only considered cigarette smoking in the present study. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Socioeconomic and geographic differences for the use of cigars, or smokeless (chewing) tobacco were not considered these analyses although these forms of tobacco use may be important to consider among certain population groups in Canada. ","[['gars, or smokeless (chewing) tobacco were not c', 'chewing', 'Gene Ontology'], ['smokeless (chewing) tobacco were not considered', 'tobacco', 'Organisms'], ['ough these forms of tobacco use may be importan', 'tobacco', 'Organisms']]","[[87, 94, 'tobacco', 'OG']]"
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"These forms of tobacco are, however, used less frequently and only in a minority of the Canadian population. [12] Further research on the patterning of occasional smoking in Canada, the use of other forms of tobacco, and potentially related factors such as alcohol use is needed. ","[['These forms of tobacco are, however, used less ', 'tobacco', 'Organisms'], ['e of other forms of tobacco, and potentially re', 'tobacco', 'Organisms']]","[[15, 22, 'tobacco', 'OG']]"
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"The overall relationship observed between socioeconomic status markers and smoking in this study was similar to what has been reported previously in Canada. [13], [35], [36] We noted strong gradients in current smoking by level of education and occupation, which were minimally changed after adjustment for potentially confounding variables. ",,[]
PMC3585192,DISCUSS,"Differences remained in rates of current smoking between provinces after accounting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in both the fixed and random effects models, although the estimated prevalence for several provinces (for example Nova Scotia and Manitoba) were ‘shrunk’ towards the national mean in the multilevel model.

PMC3648400,TITLE,A tandem regression-outlier analysis of a ligand cellular system for key structural modifications around ligand binding ,,[]
PMC3648400,UNK,Background ,,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,A tandem technique of hard equipment is often used for the chemical analysis of a single cell to first isolate and then detect the wanted identities. ,,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,The first part is the separation of wanted chemicals from the bulk of a cell; the second part is the actual detection of the important identities. ,,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,"To identify the key structural modifications around ligand binding, the present study aims to develop a counterpart of tandem technique for cheminformatics. ",,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,A statistical regression and its outliers act as a computational technique for separation. ,,[]
PMC3648400,UNK,Results ,,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,A PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonist cellular system was subjected to such an investigation. ,"[['A PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated re', 'PPARγ', 'Gene_Proteins'], ['A PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonist cellular system was ', 'peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[9, 57, 'peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma', 'GP'], [2, 7, 'PPARγ', 'GP']]"
PMC3648400,ABS,"Results show that this tandem regression-outlier analysis, or the prioritization of the context equations tagged with features of the outliers, is an effective regression technique of cheminformatics to detect key structural modifications, as well as their tendency of impact to ligand binding. ",,[]
PMC3648400,UNK,Conclusions ,,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,The key structural modifications around ligand binding are effectively extracted or characterized out of cellular reactions. ,,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,This is because molecular binding is the paramount factor in such ligand cellular system and key structural modifications around ligand binding are expected to create outliers. ,,[]
PMC3648400,ABS,"Therefore, such outliers can be captured by this tandem regression-outlier analysis. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,Background ,,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"In any chemical analysis of a single cell, the first step is the separation of wanted chemicals from the bulk of a cell. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"This is due to the fact that a cellular system has a complex, heterogeneous composition. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,Various methods [1] using hard equipment have been developed for such uses. ,,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"After a single cell is separated from the other cells, the wanted component can be further isolated and then detected through what is called a tandem technique [1]. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"The first part of a tandem technique, as mentioned above, is the separation of wanted chemicals from the bulk of a cell; the second part is the detection of the components. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"By mimicking such a tandem technique, a computational counterpart was developed herein; a statistical regression and its outliers (influential observations [2]) act as a computational technique for separation, which can cause the important identities (i.e. the factors causing outliers) to be isolated from the bulk of a cellular system. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"As a pioneer investigation, one molecular descriptor and one class of descriptors will be prepared: the descriptor resembles the filter in the tandem equipment; the class resembles the detector. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"In a ligand-dependent receptor-mediated cellular system (or ligand cellular system), key structural modifications surrounding ligand binding are expected to cause outliers. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"For example, hydrogen bond formation, or deformation, can cause drastic alterations in cellular reaction. ","[['For example, hydrogen bond formation, or deforma', 'hydrogen', 'Chemicals']]","[[13, 21, 'hydrogen', 'CD']]"
PMC3648400,INTRO,"These singular situations are, at times, the reasons for statistical breakdown points in many analyses that are otherwise correct (i.e. resulting in the outliers of a statistical regression [3,4]). ","[['These singular situations are, at times, the rea', 'singular', 'Chemicals'], ['ons for statistical breakdown points in many anal', 'breakdown', 'Gene Ontology']]","[[6, 14, 'singular', 'CD']]"
PMC3648400,INTRO,"At the same time, such outliers can have the most prominent and often most informative features of the target-specific activity landscapes [5]. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"Therefore, the concept that after this tandem regression-outlier analysis, the features of these resulting outliers can correspond to important structural modifications around molecular binding in such a ligand cellular system, if correct, would be very useful. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"For this first tandem part, we sought the most representative descriptor for the bulk system of a cell. ",,[]

PMC3648400,INTRO,All possible structural modifications in a given collected analog set are pre-assigned by ES descriptors. ,,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,The ES descriptors involve atom types in various electro-topological states. ,,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"For example, in ES terminology, an ES_Count_ssO of a molecular structure is the count of “ssO” linkages, and here the “ssO” represents a bonding oxygen atom (O) linked via two single bonds (ss). ","[['epresents a bonding oxygen atom (O) linked via two ', 'oxygen atom', 'Chemicals']]","[[145, 156, 'oxygen atom', 'CD']]"
PMC3648400,INTRO,A structural modification is considered a fundamental element (an action) for the reaction of such a ligand cellular system. ,,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"In actuality, any structural modification of such an analog set can be expressed by the change of an associated ES descriptor. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"The details and results of the second part are also depicted in the second body of materials, methods and results. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,"This tandem regression-outlier technique is, therefore, in mathematical terms, carried out so as to prioritize the context equations tagged with features of these outliers. ",,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,We want to know if the top-ranked structural modifications correspond to the key interactions around molecular binding as we expected them to. ,,[]
PMC3648400,INTRO,This expectation was based on the fact that: I: this singular situation causes outliers in a regression. ,"[[' fact that: I: this singular situation causes ou', 'singular', 'Chemicals']]","[[53, 61, 'singular', 'CD']]"

PMC5100220,DISCUSS,"Similarly, a study conducted in Nigeria [14] reported higher odds of unsuccessful outcome among those treated with 6EH. ",,[]
PMC5100220,DISCUSS,This could be due to the differences in length and type of drugs used during the continuation phase treatment those influence adherence and ultimate outcome. ,,[]
PMC5100220,DISCUSS,Studies reported that reduced continuation phase (from 6EH to 4HR) treatment is associated with lower cost and expected mortality [12] that enhance successful treatment outcome. ,,[]

PMC5100220,DISCUSS,"Apart from the treatment regimens, patient attribute like age and residence independently predicted treatment outcomes. ",,[]
PMC5100220,DISCUSS,We found that age had an inverse relation with unsuccessful outcome where the odds of unsuccessful outcome increase with age. ,,[]
PMC5100220,DISCUSS,Several studies also reported that older patients were more likely to have unsuccessful outcomes than younger [24–27]. ,,[]
PMC5100220,DISCUSS,This could be due to higher risk of age related co morbid situations those lead to poor adherence and outcomes [28]. ,,[]
PMC5100220,DISCUSS,Patients residing in rural areas had higher risk of unsuccessful outcomes which could be attributed to the low access to TB care and unfavorable living conditions. ,,[]

PMC5100220,DISCUSS,On the other hand those with unknown weight change at the end of first two months treatment had higher odds of unsuccessful outcomes. ,,[]
PMC5100220,DISCUSS,This might have occurred due to possible misclassification of cases with reduced or remains unchanged to unknown. ,,[]

PMC5982820,UNK,Developing suitable genomic selection models for abiotic stress tolerance characteristics requires the consideration of complex genotype × environment interactions (hereafter G × E interactions) within and across a target population of environments because expression of these traits is often environmentally-dependent. ,,[]
PMC5982820,UNK,"Complex patterns of G × E interactions can be incorporated into genomic prediction models, and although G × E interactions will necessarily limit gains from selection for wide adaptation, models that incorporate G × E effects can help breeders select sets of lines optimally adapted to different subsets of environments.

PMC5982820,DISCUSS,Integration of genomic selection with genotype × environment effects ,,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Our approach in this study combines the concept of a Target Population of Environments (TPE) in regard to selection (Comstock 1977; Cooper et al. 1997; Basford and Cooper 1998) with genomic prediction methods, and extends the work of Oakey et al. (2016) to a large field-based multi-environment trial. ",,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,The TPE concept applies equally to genomic selection as phenotypic selection in the face of genotype-by-environment interactions. ,,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Our results show that predictive ability depends on the extent and nature of the genetic correlation between the training and the validation populations. Heslot et al. (2013) also demonstrated empirically in wheat that G × E patterns impact genomic selection in the same way that they impact phenotypic selection. Heslot et al. (2013) also observed that the main driver of prediction accuracy between environments were G × E effects and that genomic predictions are specific to the TPE they are predicted for – conclusions also supported by Lado et al. (2013) and Oakey et al. (2016), who also showed that multi-year models could give better prediction accuracy when environmental influence is large. ","[['ated empirically in wheat that G × E pattern', 'wheat', 'Organisms']]","[[208, 213, 'wheat', 'OG']]"

",,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Researchers are faced with making choices about modeling greater complexity in the patterns of genetic correlations among environments vs. greater complexity in the genetic architecture modeled by marker data, based on tradeoffs between capturing more signal vs. overfitting and increasing computational demands as model complexity increases.

PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"For example, Sallam et al. (2015) utilized an across-experiments model for TPE identified as having low G × E so the term in the model was minimized, whereas Crossa et al. (2010) modeled genetic effects within each environment separately. Lopez-Cruz et al. (2015) introduced a model with common G × E variance for all sets, but allowed variable marker effects through a Bayesian model. Heslot et al. (2014) and Jarquín et al. (2014) introduced models that accounted for marker interactions with specific climate variables, adding another layer of complexity to the modeling of G × E patterns. ",,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Our focus in this study was to emphasize the modeling of complex patterns of heterogeneity in the genetic variation expressed within environments and the pairwise genetic correlations between environments, along with extraneous non-genetic effects. ",,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,We chose a FA model (Cullis et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2001) that can capture such heterogeneity more parsimoniously than fully unstructured models. ,,[]

PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"In contrast, the FA model approach helps breeders to understand the groupings of environments within the TPE based on their genetic correlations, and breeders can predict average performance in subsets of these environments. ",,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Both Burgueño et al. (2012) and Rutkoski et al.

PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Since we predicted values for untested lines within tested environments, our estimated prediction abilities are biased upward compared to prediction of untested lines within untested environments. ",,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Our results, which reflect upper bounds on prediction abilities across environments, demonstrate that GEBVs have reasonable accuracy only within a clearly defined cluster of environments, and have substantially worse prediction accuracy of performance in environments outside of the group of related environments for which they were predicted.

PMC5982820,DISCUSS,The FA model permits prediction of genetic values for untested lines within each site based on the genomic relationships between the untested and tested lines and also based on the genetic correlations observed among the tested set of environments. ,,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,The FA model can improve prediction accuracy within a single site over what is possible from a single-environment analysis by information sharing among environments with high genetic correlations (Guo et al. 2013; Cullis et al. 2010; Kelly et al. 2007). ,,[]

PMC5982820,DISCUSS,A drawback to the FA model is that the emphasis on including more complexity in the modeling of extraneous genetic variation and the heterogeneity of genetic covariation among environments may limit the complexity of genetic architecture models that can be tested. ,,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,The total genotypic value of each line was modeled as the sum of a polygenic additive effect and a residual genetic effect (after Oakey et al. 2016). ,,[]
PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Our results demonstrated that the residual genetic effects were more important than the additive effects in this case, which greatly limits the effectiveness of prediction of untested varieties, as those predictions depend only on the additive effects. ",,[]

PMC5982820,DISCUSS,"Levels of WSCC increase and decrease with crop development and growing conditions, meaning that full expression of the phenotype is not easily captured, and both wet chemistry and NIRS methods for measuring water soluble carbohydrates are time consuming and expensive (Gebbing and Schnyder 1999; Ruuska et al. 2006).

PMC3304128,INTRO,Introduction and Motivation ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,Most robots and automation systems rely on processing units to control their behavior. ,"[[' on processing units to control their behavior. ', 'behavior', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,Such processing units can be embedded processors (such as microcontrollers) or general purpose computers (such as PCs) with specialized Input/Output (I/O) accessories. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,One common practice is the use of USB devices with several I/O options connected to a PC. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,Another approach consists of using a microcontroller unit that runs a software algorithm to control the system. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,Frequently this microcontroller is connected to a computer to monitor and set parameters of the running system. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"Although consolidated, these approaches require specific device drivers on the host computer and special configurations. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"Moreover, if the control algorithm has to be changed, the user must reprogram the microcontroller, which in some cases requires special hardware tools such as in-circuit programmers and debuggers. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"Mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets and netbooks are widespread and getting cheaper due to their large production, making them an interesting option to control mechatronics systems. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,These devices also include several sensors that can be used in a mechatronic system. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"Examples of sensors available in modern cell phones are the global positioning system receiver (GPS), 3-axis accelerometer, compass, liquid crystal display (LCD) with touchscreen, Internet access via WiFi or GPRS/3G services, camera, speakers, microphone, bluetooth module, light sensor and battery (some have even gyroscope, barometer and stereo camera). ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"If all those accessories would be bought separately and installed in a device, the costs would be more expensive than a device with all these features already included. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"To use a mobile device as a mechatronics system main processing unit, a communication link must established between the control unit and the system under control. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"Some works [1–3] use the mobile’s device RS-232 serial port signals while others use bluetooth [1,4]. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"In all these works, a microcontroller still needs to be used to communicate with the mobile device, to read sensors and to control actuators. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"The problem is that not all mobile devices have a serial port, or bluetooth communication interface. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"Analyzing modern mobile devices it is possible to note that most of them have an universal communication interface: audio channels, that usually can be accessed through standard 3.5 mm P2 connectors. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"If there are no connectors for external audio, this article also offers a solution using suction cups to use the proposed system in mobile devices where the speakers or microphones are built-in. ",,[]

PMC3304128,INTRO,"In such system, audio tones are used to encode actuators control commands and sensors states. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"The system cost is low because only a few parts are needed (these parts are widely used in the telephony industry, making them also easy to find on the market). ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,"Moreover the system does not need any intermediate processing unit, making it flexible to easily update the running algorithm, avoiding the need of reprogramming microcontrollers. ",,[]

PMC3304128,INTRO,"It is also possible to use Kalman filtering to do sensor fusion of the camera, encoders and accelerometer to get more accurate positioning; ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,Internet: WiFi or other Internet connection can be used to remotely monitor the robot and send commands to it. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,The robot can also access a cloud system to aid some decision making process and communicate with other robots; ,,[]

PMC3304128,INTRO,"One interesting alternative is using a dedicated circuit to transform the audio output of the mobile device in a serial port signal [9], but the problem with such approach is that only unidirectional communication is possible, and still, as in the other cases, a microcontroller is needed to decode the serial signal and execute some action.

PMC3304128,INTRO,"On the other hand, the telecommunications industry frequently uses the Dial Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) system to exchange remote control commands between equipments. ",,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,Section 3.1 contains a description of the DTMF system. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,The system is more known in telephony for sending the digits that a caller wants to dial to a switching office. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,DTMF usage to control robots is not new. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,There are some recent projects that use DTMF digits exchange to remotely control robots: Patil and Henry [10] used a remote mobile phone to telecommand a robot. ,,[]
PMC3304128,INTRO,DTMF tones are sent from the mobile phone to the remote robot’s phone and decoded by a specific integrated circuit and the binary output is connected to a FPGA that controls the robot. ,,[]

PMC3304128,UNK,System Architecture ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,This section describes the proposed system architecture. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Its main advantage is to provide a universal connection system to read sensors and control actuators of mechatronics systems. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The data is exchanged using audio tones, allowing the technique to be used with any device that has audio input/output interfaces. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Theoretical Background ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The DTMF system was created in the decade of 1950 as a faster option to the (now obsolete) pulse dialing system. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Its main purpose at that time was to send the digits that a caller wants to dial to the switching system of the telephone company. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Although almost 60 years old, DTMF is still widely used in telecommunication systems and is still used in most new telephone designs [17]. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,DTMF tones can be easily heard by pressing the keys on a phone during a telephone call. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The system is composed of 16 different audio frequencies organized in a 4 × 4 matrix. Table 1 shows these frequencies and the corresponding keys/digits. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,A valid digit is always composed by a pair of frequencies (one from the table columns and one from the table rows) transmitted simultaneously. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"For example, to transmit the digit 9, an audio signal containing the frequencies 852 Hz and 1,477 Hz would have to be generated. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As DTMF was designed to exchange data via telephone lines that can be noisy, the use of 2 frequencies to uniquely identify a digit makes the system efficient and very robust to noise and other sounds that do not characterize a valid DTMF digit. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In fact, when the DTMF system was designed, the frequencies were chosen to minimize tone pairs from natural sounds [18]. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The described robustness of DTMF led its use in a variety of current remote automation systems such as residential alarm monitoring, vehicle tracking systems and interactive voice response systems such as bank’s automatic answering machines menus that allows the user to execute interactive operations like “Press 1 to check your account balance; Press 2 to block your credit card”. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The wide adoption and reliability of the DTMF system led the semiconductor industry to develop low cost integrated circuits (ICs) that can encode and decode DTMF signals from and to digital binary digits. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The system proposed in this article uses such ICs to transmit and receive information. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Both actuators control and sensors data are encoded using DTMF tones. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The following sections describe the system design. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Device Control ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"To control actuators, a mobile device generates a DTMF tone. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The tone is decoded by a commercial DTMF decoder chip (such as the MT8870), converting the tone to a 4-bit binary word equivalent to the DTMF input. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The decoded output remains present while the DTMF tone is present at the input. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The resulting bits can feed a power circuit to control up to four independent binary (on/off) devices such as robots brakes, lights or a pneumatic gripper. Figure 1 shows the basic concept of the system. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The audio output from the mobile device can be directly connected to the input of the DTMF decoder, but in some specific cases an audio preamplifier should be used to enhance the audio amplitude. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Figure 2 shows a direct current (DC) motor control application where the 4-bit output of the decoder is connected to a motor control circuit (an H-bridge, for example, using the L298 commercial dual H-bridge IC). ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As 2 bits are required to control each motor, the system can control 2 DC motors independently. Table 2 shows the DTMF digits and corresponding motor states. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Note that these states can be different according to the pin connections between the DTMF decoder and the H-bridge. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In order to control the DC motor’s speed, the mobile device turns the DTMF signals on and off in a fixed frequency, mimicking a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,To control more devices it is possible to take advantage of the fact that most audio outputs of mobile devices are stereo. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Thus, generating different audio tones in the left and right channels doubles the number of controlled devices (8 different on/off devices or 4 DC motors). ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"One interesting option, possible only in devices with USB Host feature, such as netbooks and desktop computers, is to add low cost USB multimedia sound devices, increasing the number of audio ports in the system. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Another possibility consists in directly connecting servo-motors (the ones used in model airplanes) control signals to the output of the DTMF decoder. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As each servo needs only one PWM input signal, each stereo audio channel can drive up to eight servo-motors. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Sensor Reading ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Most mechatronics systems and sensor networks need sensors to sense the surrounding environment and their own state in order to decide what to do next. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"To accomplish this task in this system, sensors are connected to the input of a DTMF encoder chip (such as the TCM5087). ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Each time a sensor state changes, the encoder generates a DTMF tone that is captured and analyzed by the mobile device. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,According to the digits received it is possible to know which sensor generated the tone. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,More details on how to identify which sensor and its value are provided in Section 5.1. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As shown in Figure 3, up to four sensors can be connected to a DTMF encoder that generates tones according to the sensors states. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The generator’s output itself is connected to the audio input of the mobile device which continuously samples the audio input checking if the frequency pair that characterizes a DTMF digit is present in the signal. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"To accomplish this task, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is used, according to Equation (1). (1)X(m)=∑n=0N−1x(n)e−j2πnm/Nwhere X(m) is the frequency magnitude of the signal under analysis at index m, x(n) is the input sequence in time (representing the signal) with n index and N is the DFT number of points. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,N determines the resolution of the DFT and the number of samples to be analyzed. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"For performance reasons, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [19] is used to identify the frequency components of the input signal and consequently detect the DTMF digit generated by the DTMF generator that encodes sensor data. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"For clear and detailed information about these digital signal processing concepts, please refer to Lyons’ book [20] on Digital Signal Processing. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,To optimize the FFT computation it is necessary to specify adequate values for N and Fs (the sample rate of the input signal). ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"From Table 1, the highest frequency present in a DTMF tone is 1,633 Hz. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Applying the fundamental sampling theorem results in Fs = 3,266 Hz (the theorem states that the sample rate should be at least twice the highest signal to be captured). ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"For implementation convenience and better compatibility, a 8 KHz sample rate is used, which most mobile devices can perform. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The lower the number of points in the FFT, the faster the FFT is computed, and more digits per second can be recognized, leading to a better sensor reading frequency. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"To compute the smallest adequate number of points for the FFT, Equation (2) is used. (2)f(m)=mFsN ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In Equation (2), f(m) is each frequency under analysis, Fs is the sampling frequency (8 KHz) and N the FFT’s number of points to be minimized. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Using N = 256, results in an analysis resolution of about 30 Hz, that is enough to differ from one DTMF frequency component to another. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,This is consistent with the DFT parameters used by Chitode to detect DTMF digits [21]. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The work developed by Khan also uses N = 256 and Fs = 8 KHz to detect DTMF tones [22]. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Later in this text, Section 5.1 and Table 3 explains the use and application of this technique to read four digital (on/off) sensors simultaneously. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,One of the limitations of the described method is that it is restricted to binary (on/off) sensors. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As it is shown is Section 5.1, this is enough for many applications, including measuring angles and speeds using incremental optical encoders. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In any case, additional electronics could be used to encode analog signals and transmit these signals using the audio interface. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As each DTMF digit encodes 4 bits, the transmission of an analog value converted with a 12-bit analog-digital converter would take 3 transmission cycles. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,It would also be possible to use digital signal multiplexing hardware to encode more information in the same system (with worse performance). ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The demultiplexing would be done in the mobile device by software. ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,Experimental Results ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"In order to evaluate the proposed system, an Android application was developed using the Android development kit, which is available for free. ","[['proposed system, an Android application was dev', 'Android', 'Chemicals'], ['developed using the Android development kit, wh', 'Android', 'Chemicals']]","[[45, 52, 'Android', 'CD']]"
PMC3304128,RESULTS,Experiments were executed in several mobile devices and desktop computers. ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"For the actuator control subsystem, experiments showed that generating PWM signals by software is possible, but the resulting signal shows variations (a software generated PWM with 1 ms ON time and 1 ms OFF time produces a real signal with 50 ms ON time and 50 ms OFF time). ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,A better option is to use pre-recorded PWM DTMF tones resulting in high reliability PWM of DTMF tones with frequencies greater than 1 KHz. ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"As mobile devices have mature software support for playing pre-recorded audio, the PWM plays smoothly with low processor usage. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"In these experiments it was also observed that another practical way of doing fine speed adjustments consists in controlling the audio output volume, resulting in proportional speed changes in the motor(s). ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,Experiments of the sensor reading subsystem are based on the FFT. ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"The experiments showed that in the worst case, the FFT computation time is 17 ms, leading to a theoretical limit of executing up to 58.8 FFTs per second. Figure 4 shows experimental results of the system running on 3 different devices. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"The tested devices were an early Android based phone, the HTC G1 with a 528 MHz ARM processor, an Android based tablet computer with a dual core 1 GHz ARM processor and a 1 GHz PC netbook with an Intel Celeron processor (in this case a version of the Android operating system for the x86 architecture was used).

PMC3304128,RESULTS,"Another performance improvement can be reached using the Goertzel algorithm [23,24]. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,From Figure 4 it is possible to note that even the device with less processing power is able to handle about 40 DTMF digits per second with zero packet loss. ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,There are several causes for the increasing packet loss that starts at 40 Hz in the plot. ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,One of the causes are the different audio input timings [25] caused by the different audio hardware of each device. ,,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,Another cause is related to the task scheduler of the Android operating system (and the underlying Linux kernel) that can be indeterministic when the CPU load is high. ,"[['sk scheduler of the Android operating system (a', 'Android', 'Chemicals']]","[[54, 61, 'Android', 'CD']]"
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"As a reference for comparison, some performance tests were made in a Lego Mindstorms (TM) robotics kit that is commonly used in educational robotics and some scientific researches. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"When connected to a computer or smartphone via a bluetooth wireless link, the maximum sensor reading rate of the Lego-NXT brick is 20 Hz. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"If several sensors are used, the bandwidth is divided. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"For example, using 2 encoders and 2 touch sensors reduces the sensor reading rate to 5 Hz per sensor or less. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"If the NXT brick is connected to a computer using the USB port, then the maximum sensor reading frequency rises to 166 Hz. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,"If two encoders and two touch sensors (bumpers) are used, then each sensor will be read at a rate of 41.5 Hz. ",,[]
PMC3304128,RESULTS,The performance of the system proposed in this article is comparable to this commercial product as a 40 Hz rate can be sustained for each sensor in a system with 4 sensors. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Case Study Application ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The system described in Section 3 can be applied to several situations where a computing device needs to control actuators and read sensors, such as laboratory experiments, machine control and robotics. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In this section, a mobile robot case study is described. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Low Cost Mobile Robot ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As an application example, the presented technique was used to build a low cost educational mobile robot. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"For the Robot’s frame, wheels, gears and two motors 24 US dollars were spent. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,For electronics parts more 6 US dollars were spent summing up a total of 30 US dollars to build the robot. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As most people own a mobile phone or a smartphone, there is the assumption that the control device will not have to be bought because a mobile device that the user already has will be used. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Even if the control device needed to be purchased, the option of using a smartphone would still be good because single board computers, typically used in robots or other robot computers, are more expensive than smartphones. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Furthermore, smartphones include camera, battery, Internet connection and a variety of sensors that would have to be bought separately and connected to the robot’s computer. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"With multi-core smartphones running with clock speeds faster than 1 GHz and with 512 MB or 1 GB of RAM memory, they are a good alternative to traditional robots computers. ","[['2 MB or 1 GB of RAM memory, they are a good al', 'memory', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Important sensors in such kind of robot are the bumpers to detect collisions and encoders to compute odometry. Figure 5 shows a block diagram connecting bumpers and 2 wheel encoders to the DTMF generator. Table 3 shows a truth table with the possible states of each sensor and the corresponding DTMF digits. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Instead of using commercial encoders discs, several encoders were designed and printed with a conventional laser printer. ","[['commercial encoders discs, several encoders w', 'discs', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The discs were glued to the robot’s wheels and a standard CNY70 light reflection sensor was mounted in front of each disc. ,"[['The discs were glued to the robot’s wheels ', 'discs', 'Gene Ontology'], ['n sensor was mounted in front of each disc. ', 'disc', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As can be seen in Table 3, there is a unique DTMF digit that corresponds to each possible sensor state. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Using basic binary arithmetic it is possible to obtain the individual state of each sensor. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"For example, from Table 3 it is known that the bumpers are the bits 0 and 1. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Using a bitwise AND operation with the binary mask 0001 will filter all other sensor states and the result will be either 0 or 1, indicating the left bumper state. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"For the right bumper, the same AND operation can be applied with the binary mask 0010. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Furthermore, using the binary 0011 mask and the AND operation will only return a value different than zero if both bumpers are activate at the same time. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Using these types of comparisons it is then possible to know the state of each sensor. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In the case of the optical encoders, the system’s software monitors for state transitions and add a unit for each transition to a counter that keeps how many pulses each encoder generated. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As seen in the Figure 5, up to four sensors can be connected to each mono audio channel, allowing closed loop control of up to 4 motors if 4 encoders are used. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Using the number of pulses accounted for each encoder it is possible to compute displacement and speed for each wheel as it is done with other incremental encoders. ,,[]

PMC3304128,UNK,The blue line shows the real traveled distance and the red line shows the distance measured by the mobile phone using the proposed technique. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Each point in the graph is the average value of ten samples. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"According to McComb and Predko, odometry errors are unavoidable due to several factors such as wheels’ slip and small measurement errors in the wheel radius that accumulate over time. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"They say that a displacements of 6 to 9 meters leads to 15 centimeters odometer error [28] or more, which is a percentual error of 1.6%–2.5%. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The greatest odometry error of the system was 3.7% for 74 cm range. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,But for 130 cm displacements the error was 1 centimeter (0.76%). ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,These values show that the proposed system performance is consistent with classical odometry errors described in the literature. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"To close the control loop, the computed odometry information is sent to a classical PI (Proportional-Integral) controller that has as set-points (or goals) the desired distance to be displaced by the robot. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The encoders are read at a 40 Hz rate, the position is computed and sent to the controller to decide if the robot has to go faster, stop or walk. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"If any of the bumpers are activated in the meantime, the control loop is interrupted and the robot immediately stops. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"Although most mobile devices have the possibility of recording and reproducing sounds, not all of them have physical connectors for both the audio input and output. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"To solve this problem in one of the tested devices that does not have an audio input connector, an earphone is attached near the built-in microphone of the device using a suction cup. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In this particular case, an audio preamplifier must be used to generate tones with sufficient amplitude to be detected. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The DTMF tones encoding sensors data is generated, amplified and sent to the earphone fixed very near the built-in microphone of the mobile device. ",,[]

PMC3304128,UNK,Distance Measurement ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,An important sensor to aid the navigation of autonomous mobile robots is the distance measurement from the robot to obstacles in front of it. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,This task is typically performed by ultrasound or laser sensors. ,,[]

PMC3304128,UNK,"To support distance measurement in this low cost robot, a laser module (laser pointer) is used to project a brilliant red dot in the object in front of the robot. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The camera then captures a frame and uses the projected dot position on its image plane to compute the distance to the obstacle based on simple trigonometry. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,This method is described by Danko [29] and better explained by Portugal-Zambrano and Mena-Chalco [30]. ,"[[' by Portugal-Zambrano and Mena-Chalco [30]. ', 'Mena', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[85, 89, 'Mena', 'GP']]"
PMC3304128,UNK,The algorithm assumes that the brightest pixels on the captured image are on the laser projected dot. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Figure 7 depicts how the system works. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,A laser pointer parallel to the camera emits a focused red dot that is projected in an object at distance D from the robot. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,This red dot is reflected and projected in the camera’s image plane. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The distance pfc (pixels from center) between the center of the image plane (in the optical axis) and the red dot in the image plane is proportional to the distance D. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Equation (4) shows how to compute the distance using described system. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The distance between the camera and the laser (H) is known previously, the number of pixels from the image center to the red laser dot (pfc) is obtained from the image. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"The radians per pixels (rpc) and the radian offset (ro) are obtained calibrating the system, which consists of taking several measurements of objects at known distances and their pixels distance from center (pfc). ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Then a linear regression algorithm finds the best ro and rpc. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Details on this calibration can be found on the work of Portugal-Zambrano and Mena-Chalco [30]. (4)D=Htan(pfc*rpc+ro ,"[['rtugal-Zambrano and Mena-Chalco [30]. (4)D=H', 'Mena', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[78, 82, 'Mena', 'GP']]"
PMC3304128,UNK,"As can be seem in Equation (4), the measurement range depends mainly on the baseline H given by the distance between the laser and the camera and the number of pixels from the image center, pfc, that has a limit given by the camera resolution. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,This equation can be used to determine the measurement range. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"As the object gets farther away, its pfc tends to zero. ",,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,Assuming pfc to be zero it is possible to simplify Equation (4) to Equation (5) which gives the maximum distance that can be measured. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,"In the same way, the minimum distance is given by half the camera resolution (because the measurement is made from the point to the center of image). Equation (6) specifies the minimum measurement distance. Table 5 shows some possible range values computed using these equations. (5)Dmax=Htan(ro) (6)Dmin=Htan(r2*rpc+ro) ",,[]

PMC3304128,UNK,Experimental Results ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The algorithm implementation is straightforward: the system has to scan a region of the image for a group of pixels with the greatest values (255) in the red channel. ,,[]
PMC3304128,UNK,The current implementation searches for a pattern of 5 pixels in a cross shape. ,,[]

PMC3304128,CONCL,Conclusions ,,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,This paper introduces a simple but universal control architecture that enables a wide variety of devices to implement control of mechatronics and automation systems. ,,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,"The method can be used to implement closed loop control systems in mechatronics systems using audio channels of computing devices, allowing the processing unit to be easily replaced without the need of pairing or special configurations. ",,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,"Several obsolete and current devices can be used to control robots such as PDAs, phones and computers. ",,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,Even an MP3 player could be used if control without feedback is needed. ,"[['Even an MP3 player could be used if control', 'MP3', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[8, 11, 'MP3', 'GP']]"
PMC3304128,CONCL,The sound produced by the player would drive the motors. ,,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,"As an application example, the presented method is used to build a mobile robot with differential drive. ",,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,"The robot’s complete costs, including frame, motors, sensors and electronics is less than 30 US dollars (in small quantities), and the parts can be easily found in stores or on the Internet. ",,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,The mentioned price does not include the mobile device. ,,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,"The method can be used for several applications such as educational robotics, low cost robotics research platforms, telepresence robots, autonomous and remotely controlled robots. ",,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,"In engineering courses it is also a motivation for students to learn digital signal processing theory, and all the other multidisciplinary fields involved in robotics. ",,[]
PMC3304128,CONCL,"Another interesting application of this system is to build sensor networks composed of smartphones that can gather data from their internal sensors and poll external sensors via audio tones, allowing sensor networks to be easily built and scaled using commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices instead of specific boards and development kits.

PMC3189878,UNK,Background ,,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,"With health sector reform in Vietnam moving towards greater pluralism, commune health stations (CHSs) have been subject to growing competition from private health services and increasing numbers of patients bypassing CHSs for higher-level health facilities. ",,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,"This study describes the pattern of reproductive health (RH) and family planning (FP) service utilization among women at CHSs and other health facilities, and explores socio-demographic determinants of RH service utilization at the CHS level.

PMC3189878,UNK,Methods ,,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,"This study was based on a cross-sectional survey conducted in Thua Thien Hue and Vinh Long provinces, using a multi-stage cluster sampling technique. ",,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,"Questionnaire-based interviews with 978 ever-married women at reproductive age provided data on socio-demographic characteristics, current use of FP methods, history of RH service use, and the health facility attended for their most recent services. ",,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify socio-demographic determinants of their use of CHS RH services. ,"[['erminants of their use of CHS RH services. ', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[107, 110, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,UNK,Results ,,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,Eighty nine percent of ever-married women reported current use of birth control with 49% choosing intra-uterine device (IUD). ,,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,Eighty nine percent of pregnant women attended facility-based antenatal care (ANC) with 62% having at least 3 check-ups during their latest pregnancy. ,,[]
PMC3189878,ABS,Ninety one percent of mothers had their last delivery in a health facility. ,,[]

PMC3189878,INTRO,Background ,,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"With the introduction of its ""Doi Moi"" or 'renovation' policy in 1986, Vietnam has shifted from a centrally planned towards a market-oriented economy. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,Health sector reform has introduced user fees in public hospitals and legalized private practice. ,,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"In urban centers in particular, the private health sector has been growing rapidly, and increasingly is in competition with the public sector in providing health services. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"These changes have produced profound effects on the use of health services at state health facilities, including RH care at the local CHS - the basic unit of the primary healthcare system in Vietnam [1,2].

PMC3189878,INTRO,The state health system in Vietnam consists of 4 levels: the national level with the Ministry of Health and central hospitals; the provincial level with the Provincial Department of Health and provincial hospitals; the district level with district health centers and district hospitals; and the communal level with CHSs. ,,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"RH and FP services are available at all-level state health facilities: central, provincial, district hospitals and CHSs. ",,[]

PMC3189878,INTRO,"Private healthcare services in Vietnam comprise three differing service structures [5,6]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,Private hospital care is principally located in major cities. ,,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"Compared to state hospitals, they have a reputation for their access to more advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technology, and their capacity to provide technically demanding services. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"Private outpatient clinics are operated by individuals or groups of full- or part-time physicians in urban, sub-urban and rural areas, under a license from provincial health authorities. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,They largely provide general or specialized health services for middle income patients. ,,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"Third, ""mobile"" private practitioners--who can be nurses, assistant doctors, or retired doctors--are commonly present in rural areas, providing health services from their own homes without a license. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"These health practitioners are not included as part of the formal health system, although they play an important role in providing basic health services [6]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"For RH services at the commune level, private providers include doctors or practitioners (e.g. midwives, assistant doctors), and traditional birth attendants, who provide home-based delivery services [7,8]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"In addition, local pharmacies can offer the commercial sale of birth control commodities such as oral contraceptives, without prescription. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"With the reduction in government subsidies for CHS facilities, equipment, and human resources development, the quality of health services at CHSs has been perceived as deteriorating and is associated with less-qualified health staff, outdated equipment, limited drugs and supplies [2].

PMC3189878,INTRO,"At the same time, the private sector has been increasingly popular and is associated with convenient opening hours, more competent staff, better equipment, and effective drug prescriptions [9]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,INTRO,"Reports suggest that increasingly, patients are seeking care at private clinics or bypassing their local CHS for higher level health facilities, willing to pay higher fees based on their perceptions of better quality and enhanced technology [1,2,10,11].

PMC3189878,DISCUSS,Hospitals dominate the provision of delivery services. ,,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,There were marked differentials in women's selection of service providers for ANC and delivery services between rural and urban areas. ,,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Data on behavioral RH care indicators in the selected districts were impressive with a very high proportion of married women currently using a birth control method, high rates of pregnant women having sufficient ANC and giving birth at a health facility. ","[[' sufficient ANC and giving birth at a health facilit', 'giving birth', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"These data were comparable with the national-level statistics over the past 5 years [13] that reported high national rates of contraceptive use (80%-90%), at least 3 antenatal visits in pregnant women (87%), and deliveries attended by trained health personnel (95% or higher) [14,15]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,The pattern of birth control methods currently used was also keeping with the national data that reported IUD to be the most popular method applied by around 56% of married couples [14]. ,,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"The high levels of contraceptive use, with the local CHS as the major supplier, indicates that the model of providing FP services in Vietnam is effective, and able to meet local needs. ","[['use, with the local CHS as the major suppli', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[53, 56, 'CHS', 'GP']]"

","[['Over time, the CHS has gained a reputation ', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[15, 18, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"The contribution of the local pharmacy is also significant, diversifying the provision of condoms or other contraceptive commodities at the commune level. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,The hospital and private providers appear to have a little role in the provision of IUD services and other FP commodities (i.e. condoms or pills). ,,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"The CHS also appears to be a major provider for antenatal check-ups, particularly in the rural area, although the number of private antenatal service users was significant. ","[['The CHS also appears to be a major provider', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[4, 7, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"This finding counters previous studies that reported lower use of primary healthcare and outpatient treatment services at CHSs compared to private clinics or hospitals [1,16]. ",,[]

PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"However, while CHSs continue to dominate the provision of ANC services, a preference for delivery in hospitals was clear in these districts, a finding consistent with rising economic status and increasing patient expectations of the health system in Vietnam [2,8,17]. ",,[]

PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Our data support earlier studies that found a low use of CHS delivery services, with most women preferring district hospital-based delivery because of the perceived better quality of services for both mothers and newborn [7,8]. ","[[' found a low use of CHS delivery services, ', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[57, 60, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"The data also support the qualitative study in these provinces that noted the 2-child population control policy has made couples more cautious about outcomes for their baby, choosing hospital-based delivery where they are more confident in provider's expertise and equipment, and life saving emergency care is readily available [4]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,The high use of gynecological check-up services at the local CHS was attributed in part to the national RH semi-annual campaign. ,"[['rvices at the local CHS was attributed in p', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[61, 64, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Although this national campaign is aimed at early detection and treatment of RTIs, population-based studies conducted within the last 10 years, including one study in Thua Thien Hue, reported a prevalence of RTIs ranging from 21% to 39% among women of reproductive age [18-20]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"The RTIs prevalence was found to be even higher in hospital- or clinic-based studies, though these were subject to selection bias [21,22]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"While RTIs can change overtime and vary by provinces, such high prevalence raises questions around the strategic use of CHS-based free gynecological check-ups during the national semi-annual RH campaign, with questions over the quality and efficacy of this service as an intervention strategy. ","[['he strategic use of CHS-based free gynecolo', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[120, 123, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Private physicians were important providers for ANC services in both rural and urban areas, despite their uneven geographical distribution. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"With RH private clinics mostly concentrated in urban areas, using private services not only incurred higher fees, but also travel expenses for rural women. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Yet, a significant proportion of rural women used private clinics during their latest pregnancy. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Previous studies report criticism of state facilities and a preference for reproductive healthcare provided at private clinics, though, paradoxically, these private clinics are serviced by physicians who routinely work in state health facilities [23]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"In the private clinics, clients may be entitled to direct access to more senior clinicians, and find staff more responsive, compared to their reception in state services [23]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"While CHSs maintained dominance in provision of ANC services, there was a clear upwards trend for the use of private antenatal services, consistent with trends for other health service use in Vietnam [1,2]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"In essence, the patterns of RH service provider choice were driven by socio-economic and geographic factors. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Women of lower socio-economic status, who were farmers, earning a lower income, having more than 2 children, and living in a rural area were more likely to use antenatal, delivery, and/or gynecological check-up services at the local CHS.

PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Among the 2 provinces, a higher percentage of women in Thua Thien Hue reported visiting their local CHS for ANC and gynecological check up services. ","[['isiting their local CHS for ANC and gynecol', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[100, 103, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"This difference can be explained by the higher number of CHSs in sampled communes in Thua Thien Hue staffed by a doctor (13), compared to those in Vinh Long (10) [25]. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"In Vinh Long, 2 of 3 districts included in the survey had an accredited private RH clinic, while there were none in rural districts of Thua Thien Hue. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"This was reflected in the findings that more rural women in Vinh Long used antenatal check-ups at private clinics and fewer of them used this service at the CHS compared to their counterparts in Thua Thien Hue, though in both provinces, there were low levels of delivery in private facilities. ","[['this service at the CHS compared to their c', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[157, 160, 'CHS', 'GP']]"

PMC3189878,DISCUSS,The study findings should be considered in conjunction with the limitations of the research. ,,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"The sample was drawn from districts purposively selected for the intervention project, and thus not representative for the whole province. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Although the percentage of women who have a current sexual partner (3%) was consistent with national data on prevalence of premarital sex among young women (5.2%), [26] the sample of unmarried women was too small for meaningful statistical analyses. ",,[]
PMC3189878,DISCUSS,"Data were self-reported, and may incur recall bias with regards to the history of RH service use, particularly with ANC and delivery services. ",,[]
PMC3189878,CONCL,Conclusions ,,[]
PMC3189878,CONCL,"Although the CHS in this study retains significant utilization rates and constitutes an important provider of primary RH services, it is under challenge on three fronts. ","[['Although the CHS in this study retains sign', 'CHS', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[13, 16, 'CHS', 'GP']]"
PMC3189878,CONCL,"The first challenge is from the significant use of private practice for ANC, where clients have direct access to higher grades of health care providers, and are willing to pay higher fees for their perceptions of better quality of care. ",,[]
PMC3189878,CONCL,"Secondly, although the semi-annual gynecological screening continues to attract significant numbers of women with its subsidized service, its effectiveness as a population strategy is questionable, and the quality of services needs evaluation. ",,[]
PMC3189878,CONCL,"Thirdly, the preference for delivery in district hospitals over CHS is marked, and arguably, government services would do well to move towards strengthened referral services and shared care with the CHS, rather than invest in duplication of these functions at both levels.

PMC3189878,CONCL,"Those CHSs that attempt to function in the shadow of hospital facilities need to be protected by referral practices and clear differentiation of services to avoid unnecessary provision of routine RH care by more costly staff, in higher cost level facilities. ",,[]

PMC3189878,CONCL,"With the reduction in government subsidies, a responsive payment scheme must be developed at the CHS level that generates income for the sustainable provision of quality services, but retains subsidized services for the poor who continue to rely on their local CHS for basic reproductive healthcare.

PMC4349710,RESULTS,"Key differences in the attribution of outpatient costs for HZ and PHN have been reported for Italy; for patients that did not develop PHN, the majority of the cost of management has been reported to be due to the cost of medication (83%) whereas for patients that develop PHN a greater proportion of cost was attributed to diagnostic and investigative procedures [29]. ",,[]
PMC4349710,RESULTS,"Other studies, however, indicate costs of diagnostic procedures to be the smallest contributor to outpatient costs among patients with HZ and PHN (PHN-1 and PHN-3) [27]. ",,[]
PMC4349710,RESULTS,"While the average cost of outpatient management per case is higher for patients with PHN than for patients with HZ, when considering overall burden of disease at a country level, the overall cost of disease is higher for HZ. ",,[]

PMC4349710,RESULTS,"In Spain, the findings from an observational study [27] of 130 HZ patients aged 19–45 (median age of 63.5 yrs) who were observed for 1 year suggest that an average of 4.3 hours of work were missed per patient at a cost of €52.98. ",,[]
PMC4349710,RESULTS,"This study also found that a total of 6 work hours were lost by carers across the study sample of 130, resulting in a total loss of €86.31. ",,[]
PMC4349710,RESULTS,The cost and time implications of time taken off work by carers were also considered in two further studies that were conducted in Belgium and the UK respectively. ,,[]
PMC4349710,RESULTS,"The study conducted in Belgium found that 14/184 patients reported that someone else could not go to work due to their illness for between 0.5-10days, resulting in an average loss of €52 per case due to carer absenteeism [40]. ",,[]
PMC4349710,RESULTS,"For the study conducted in the UK, among 70 HZ patients, a total of 52 work days were lost by their carers [7]. ",,[]

PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"The aim of this article was to provide a holistic overview of the published literature concerning the humanistic, economic and societal burden of HZ and PHN in Europe. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"The reviewed evidence highlights the significant burden of HZ and PHN for patients, healthcare systems and wider society. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,A number of key findings are noted. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Firstly, the direct costs of managing HZ represent a significant proportion of the total costs associated with the disease, with higher costs associated with the presence of PHN and with greater pain severity. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Secondly, absenteeism was identified as a significant cost driver (albeit in a small number of studies), with up to 65% of employed patients reporting work absence due to their disease. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Lastly, research suggests that age, pain severity and the presence of PHN are the key drivers of burden to patients, healthcare systems and society. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,In Europe the percentage of people aged 65 years or over is projected to increase from 17.1% (84.6million) in 2008 to 30.0% (151.5 million) in 2060 [85]. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,This demographic shift is likely to have a profound influence on the incidence of HZ and PHN and may contribute to increased concern among European healthcare authorities; particularly if economic crisis and healthcare budget constrains persist in the long term. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,Findings from this review indicate that the direct costs of HZ and PHN management are greater for older patients. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"In addition, older adults typically have lower HRQoL than younger adults (deficits which are more pronounced with the presence of HZ and PHN) and may be less able to complete activities of daily living and self-care unassisted. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"The potential implications of an aging population to wider society, therefore, are wide reaching. ","[[' implications of an aging population to wider', 'aging', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,Limitations of the current literature and potential gaps that provide opportunities for future research ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,A number of limitations concerning the currently available body of evidence were identified. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,Inconsistencies in data ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of PHN and a lack of consistency in the definition of PHN employed in studies was evident throughout the review. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,This presents a number of challenges when attempting to accurately understand the burden of HZ and PHN. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"For example, it has been demonstrated that the prevalence of PHN varies dramatically depending on the point at which HZ-related pain becomes classified as PHN (PHN1 or PHN3) [86]. ","[['omes classified as PHN (PHN1 or PHN3) [86]. ', 'PHN1', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[160, 164, 'PHN1', 'GP']]"
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Accurately attributing costs to HZ and PHN and determining the overall cost burden of the conditions, therefore, is difficult. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Similarly, cost per case may vary dramatically depending on the definition employed. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"For this reason, PHN definitions employed in the referenced studies have been highlighted throughout this review and should be considered when interpreting the findings from individual studies. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Furthermore, there is a lack of consistency in the use of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes used to identify PHN patients in clinical practice. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"As a result, there may be a significant proportion of PHN patients who have not been considered in these studies; consequently decreasing confidence in the accuracy of estimates regarding the burden of PHN. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"A lack of consistency in the ways in which data had been collected provides further difficulties in interpreting and comparing the available data across studies, with databases, patient records and patient surveys all utilized. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"For example, rates of resource use were derived from a range of sources including: analysis of patient records or an observed sample, patient responses to surveys and national and insurance databases, with each of these methods having their own limitations. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"The use of databases is a valuable way of gathering data at a national level, however it assumes information is recorded consistently and accurately across databases and that the database has adequate and representative population coverage. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Analysis of patient records assumes information is accurately recorded by GPs, who have a myriad of demands on their time, and analysis of patient’s responses assumes accuracy in their recall. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Of note, the incidence of hospitalisations were largely based on rates derived from databases in different countries, or rates recorded in observed samples, thus inaccuracies may occur when these data are extrapolated to the country population. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Variation in reports of healthcare resource use, indirect costs and humanistic burden are also likely to have resulted from inconsistency in the time frame that different studies considered relevant. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"With respect to the literature on economic burden, it is understood that costs are likely to vary between countries in terms of the cost of medical resources, medical visits and prescribed medications. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Currently these differences are not reflected in the published literature and in some cases, the cost of treating a case of HZ or PHN were calculated inconsistently, with some studies presenting the cost per treated case while others presented the average across all patients. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,As such there was a wide variation between studies. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,Only one study provided costs (per treated case) for the different types of medications used to treat HZ or PHN [46]. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Similarly, no studies provided breakdown or clarification of cost elements included in a ‘hospital stay’. ","[['no studies provided breakdown or clarification of', 'breakdown', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Great caution, therefore, should be taken in comparing and interpreting the available data. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,Furthermore this highlights an unmet need for data that clearly distinguishes between HZ and PHN and also for ‘per treated case’ data for a wide range of EU countries. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,A further notable limitation was that data were not available for all EU countries. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Despite comprehensive database searches, in which no restrictions on country of interest or language of publication were implemented, cost burden data for the majority of Eastern European countries was not identified. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"The majority of studies, instead, focus primarily on the UK, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium and Germany. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,Gaps in evidence ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"A number of evidence gaps were identified, some of which provide opportunities for future research. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,A key gap identified in the available evidence pool relates to how indirect costs are assessed. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"While a number of EU studies presented data on the time missed from work and associated costs, data on productivity while at work and associated costs is lacking. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Studies in the US and Canada, however, report that presenteeism could account for up to 75% of the cost burden associated with work loss [87] and that an average of 46 hours were lost (per employed patient) due to presenteeism [88]. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"In Europe, decisions regarding access and reimbursement of medical interventions are predominately driven by considerations of cost-effectiveness. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Consideration of the impact of conditions as reported by patients themselves, however, provides important information regarding unmet need and the efficacy of medical interventions. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,A number of studies assessing aspects of humanistic burden associated with HZ and PHN were identified. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"However, there are number of notable limitations. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Firstly, the impact of HZ and PHN was generally assessed using disease specific questionnaires (such as the ZBPI) or ‘bespoke’ questions which have not been tested or validated. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,There was only limited use of generic HRQoL instruments in the EU studies conducted to date. ,,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"However, data from such instruments are valuable for quantifying burden with reference to the normative population and patients with other diseases – data that is important for contextualizing the relative burden associated with HZ and PHN. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"The available evidence does not typically look beyond the pain which accompanies or persists beyond the rash and the omission of other factors that can impact on patients’ quality of life (e.g. fatigue, stomach upsets, allodynia, and numbness). ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"This should be addressed, preferably through a combination of quantitative and qualitative research, the latter of which was notably lacking in the literature. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Finally, the lack of literature relating to the wider societal burden potentially caused by HZ and PHN (particularly with respect to the impact on caregivers and the broader implications of HZ and PHN on provision of formal and informal social care) may be considered a critical gap. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"To date burden among informal caregivers has rarely been considered, and only in terms of time lost from work. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Significantly, this omits the potential impacts of providing informal care to patients that may not have resulted in time lost from work (e.g. negative impact on the health and well-being of caregivers). ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Furthermore, consideration of healthcare resource use and the economic burden of HZ and PHN has typically focussed on impacts within the healthcare system; the broader implications of HZ and PHN are rarely appreciated. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"For example, the functional deficits observed among HZ and PHN patients that may lead to a loss of autonomy and increased reliance on formal paid care have not been estimated. ",,[]
PMC4349710,DISCUSS,"Beyond some evidence of direct and indirect costs related to the disease, the potential impact of HZ and PHN on the social care system remains unknown. ",,[]
PMC4349710,CONCL,Conclusions ,,[]
PMC4349710,CONCL,"This literature review highlights the burden faced by patients, healthcare systems and society due to HZ and PHN in Europe. ",,[]
PMC4349710,CONCL,"While the incidence of HZ and PHN increases with age, the total cost per case of HZ and PHN management is not necessarily age-dependent. ",,[]
PMC4349710,CONCL,"Pain severity was associated with increased costs for both HZ and PHN, and, as a chronic condition, costs were higher for patients experiencing PHN. ",,[]
PMC4349710,CONCL,"No study fully addressed the humanistic and economic burden of HZ and PHN to patients, their families and society as a whole. ",,[]
PMC4349710,CONCL,"Based on the reviewed evidence and an assessment of the gaps in the evidence base, it is likely that the true burden of HZ and PHN is underestimated in the Europe. ",,[]

PMC5356474,METHODS,"The D statistic involves four genomes: a genome from each of two sister populations (P1 and P2), a genome from a third population as the potential source of introgression (P3), and an outgroup genome (O) to identify the ancestral state (identified as the A allele). ",,[]

PMC5134075,TITLE,Navigating the journey of Aboriginal childhood disability: a qualitative study of carers’ interface with services ,,[]
PMC5134075,UNK,Background ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,The disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with a disability is well recognized. ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,"The long term consequences of failing to address disability on health, education and employment underlies the importance of early intervention. ",,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,Caregivers experience a disproportionate burden and have challenges accessing services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,The aim of this study was to describe the carer journey of accessing support and services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,UNK,Methods ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with nineteen parents and carers of Aboriginal children aged 0–8 years. ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,The children were patients at a child developmental clinic at a metropolitan area Aboriginal health service in Eastern Australia. ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,Interpretive phenomenological analysis was applied to transcribed verbatim accounts. ,,[]
PMC5134075,UNK,Results ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,"Four themes were developed using the ‘journey’ metaphor to describe the carer pathway of accessing support and services at the community, service and policy levels. ",,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,"Themes included 1) the need for increased signage within communities via community education, information and awareness, 2) wrong way signs, roundabouts and roadblocks encountered when accessing services, 3) alternate routes can facilitate the journey, and 4) incompatibility of inflexible bureaucratic road rules and lived realities. ",,[]
PMC5134075,UNK,Conclusions ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,The challenges of caring for a child with a disability are indisputable and these can be compounded for people experiencing socio-economic disadvantage and marginalisation. ,,[]
PMC5134075,ABS,"Overcoming challenges to service access faced by carers of Aboriginal children with a disability will require investment in community, services and policy to tailor culturally appropriate models of care. ",,[]

PMC5134075,INTRO,Background ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,Disparity in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander childhood disability - impact on outcomes ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"The opportunity for health, social development, education and wellbeing in people with disabilities can be easily blighted by adverse social and environmental forces and commonly the needs of individuals can be invisible [1]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"In Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples suffer worse health and more disadvantage than other Australians, the effects of which are exacerbated by dispossession, disempowerment and racism [2, 3]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,The disparities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and other Australian children are also highlighted in experiences of disability [4–6]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are more likely to experience hearing loss [7–9], linked to higher rates of middle ear disease such as otitis media [4], and to require assistance with self-care, mobility or communication than other children [10]. ","[['ikely to experience hearing loss [7–9], linke', 'hearing', 'Gene Ontology'], ['her rates of middle ear disease such as otitis medi', 'ear disease', 'Diseases'], ['ear disease such as otitis media [4], and to require', 'otitis media', 'Diseases']]","[[150, 162, 'otitis media', 'DS'], [130, 141, 'ear disease', 'DS']]"
PMC5134075,INTRO,Disparities have also been reported in the prevalence of developmental delay [11]. ,"[['en reported in the prevalence of developmental delay [11]. ', 'developmental delay', 'Diseases']]","[[57, 76, 'developmental delay', 'DS']]"
PMC5134075,INTRO,"The high prevalence of disability can have life-long negative consequences on health, education and employment outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children [9, 12]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,Evidence links low educational achievement to involvement in the criminal justice system [13]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,On average Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth are detained within the juvenile justice system at 24 times the rate of other youth [6] and are 4 to 5 times more likely to have an intellectual disability than the general population [14]. ,"[['e likely to have an intellectual disability than the general po', 'intellectual disability', 'Diseases']]","[[187, 210, 'intellectual disability', 'DS']]"
PMC5134075,INTRO,Adolescents coming into contact with the juvenile justice system are more likely to be incarcerated as an adult [15]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"The World Health Organization recognizes the importance of social determinants in influencing health outcomes, and the Close the Gap Campaign is an important focus of Australian government and non-government organisations to address the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"Internationally, indigenous children with a disability are considered ‘doubly disadvantaged’ [16, 17]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,A recent longitudinal cohort study of development in urban Aboriginal children found that high levels of socio-economic disadvantage are a predictor for developmental progress [18]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"While the high levels of socio-economic disadvantage increases the chance of having a disability, the high rates of disability can contribute to socio-economic disadvantage, thus reinforcing a life-long cycle [6]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,Impact of service access barriers on early intervention ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,Early intervention is crucial to counteracting the negative impact of disability for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children [4]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"It is necessary to facilitate timely access of children and their families to appropriate health services, social support services and treatment. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"This involves interacting with a health care system that is not always accommodating of unique, socio-cultural needs. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"Involvement of sectors other than health, such as education and social services, is also required for effective early intervention but increases the complexity of engagement [18–20]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,Carers report a number of barriers to accessing early intervention and support services [21]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"Lack of awareness of appropriate disability services, frequent absence of culturally appropriate support, insufficient resources to provide care, and a loss of social-capital-based support due to fractured family and community structures have been reported as barriers to service access which impedes early intervention [21, 22]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,A holistic approach to service access ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,Improving service access is important to addressing health disparities [23]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"Influencing factors exist at the micro, meso and macro levels [24–27]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"A holistic approach is required when addressing service access issues for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families of a child with a disability [25, 28]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,Desirable outcomes are unlikely to be achieved if the interdependency of influencing factors is not addressed. ,,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"For example, carers play a central role as navigators of their child’s care [29], thus, exploring the experiences of carers is imperative in understanding service access for children with a disability. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"Data on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with a disability are limited, particularly in urban populations and this inhibits adequate service planning [30]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"Although over half of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population live in urban or regional areas, most of the research on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander childhood disability is on rural or remote populations [24, 31–33]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"It is important to address this gap in knowledge as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations can be less visible in urban areas and available services are not necessarily appropriate or accessible [21, 32, 34, 35]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,INTRO,"To address this paucity of information, we investigated the experiences of Aboriginal carers to inform service planning and access to early intervention. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Methods ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,We aimed to describe the carer experience of accessing support and services and investigate the barriers and facilitators to service access from the perspective of carers. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"We used a socio-ecological framework to situate carers’ experiences at the macro- (government), exo- (organizational) and meso- (provider/community) system levels in recognition of the interaction and inter-dependence of these environmental factors. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The carer, child and family are positioned within the centre, or the individual-level, of the socio-ecological framework. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The micro-level (individual) experiences included caring for the child and family, challenges and facilitators to this caring, carer health and wellbeing and associated financial expenses and non-economic costs (manuscript under review). ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"This paper reports on the carers’ interaction with systems beyond their immediate family; that being, the community, service and policy levels of the framework in pursuit of optimal outcomes for their child with a disability. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"To understand carers’ experiences and perspectives of seeking and obtaining health and social service supports for their children, we used a phenomenological approach [36]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Context, participants and recruitment ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Participants were parents or informal primary carers (hereafter, carers) of children aged 0–8 years who were patients at a child development clinic at a metropolitan area Aboriginal health service. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The clinic caters to children with developmental problems aged from birth to 16 years and deals with the identification and management of conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioural problems and developmental delays.

PMC5134075,METHODS,Clinic staff informed potential participants about the study and supplied information sheets and flyers to interested parties. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The term disability was deliberately kept broad to include a range of disability experiences including mild, moderate and severe, involving physical, intellectual or developmental issues. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Recruitment continued until no new issues emerged. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Data collection ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The research team was co-led by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal team members, each with designated tasks and expertise, who frequently met to discuss research processes, debrief about ongoing data collection, and strategize to overcome logistical challenges. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"To capture the range of experiences and perspectives of caring for a child with a disability, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews at two time-points with each participant. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Initial interviews were conducted at the health facility in private clinic rooms with one of two researchers trained in qualitative methods (AA & BB). ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,These interviews lasted approximately 20–60 min and often occurred opportunistically while waiting for or immediately following their child’s clinic appointment. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Children sometimes were in the room during interviews, usually playing or sleeping, because no other supervision was available. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Follow-up interviews were conducted with participants to ascertain and document activities related to the child’s disability, services sought, interactions with health or other service professionals, and barriers and facilitators to support since the first interview. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Follow-up interviews took place via telephone if participants were unable to attend the service in person. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,All follow-up interviews were conducted within 6–12 months of the initial interviews according to the preference and availability of participants. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Participants were reimbursed for travel and child care expenses incurred as a result of participation. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Data collection took place from April 2013 to June 2015. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Interviewers ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,The Aboriginal leaders and cultural mentors of the project were unable to undertake interviews given their management roles at the health facility. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"This meant that the non-Aboriginal team members, who worked in another area of the health service one or more days each week, were designated to conduct the interviews whenever clinic staff telephoned with an eligible consenting participant. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,One of these interviewers was a general practitioner (GP) at the health service and a university academic. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"She had met some of the participants previously in the context of primary care consultations, however she was not involved directly in the child’s healthcare or the clinic. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Prior to commencing interviews, she explained the research role to participants as separate to her GP role. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"As a non-Aboriginal woman having worked part-time for over twenty years at the health service where this research was conducted, this interviewer had extensive knowledge and experience within the local community and health service. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The second interviewer, also a non-Aboriginal woman, had qualifications in psychology and was a health services researcher based at a university. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,She had been a weekly visiting counsellor at the health service for 8 years. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Two local Aboriginal elders (CC & DD) co-led this project and acted as cultural mentors who contributed to the study design, recruitment and analysis. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"At each stage, they offered perspectives of findings conveyed in repeated discussions with the interviewers. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Each described their positioning in relation to this research and described their conscious biases to clarify their interpretations. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Some, but not all, members of this team had the experience of parenting or caring for a child with a disability. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,The interviewers met periodically to debrief and consider interview proceedings. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Each provided important insights that informed the others’ interpretations. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The cultural mentors and GP interviewer provided service and community context from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal perspectives, respectively, while the university interviewer offered a less entrenched experience of the community, yet with an appreciation of historical and social context. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,The semi-structured interviews attended primarily to the carer’s own narrative. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Interview topics were derived from a literature review [24], experience and expertise of cultural mentors who were also carers, and the social determinants of health and social capital frameworks [2, 17, 37] (Additional file 1). ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"During interviews, we explored participant’s experiences with the child’s disability, their meanings and interpretations of these experiences, and their experiences seeking and obtaining support and services. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Attention was paid to experiences of intake and triage, respite use and need, allied health service access and needs and preferences for information, services and support. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Limited demographic and health-related information was collected during the interviews. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Upon the follow-up interview, the interviewer summarised thematic content of the previous interview with participants to seek confirmation of its validity [38]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Any noted discrepancies were discussed, clarified and resolved to the satisfaction of the participant. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Data analysis and trustworthiness ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Analysis began with development of a contact summary sheet with key demographic information and emergent issues [39] for each interview. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to analyse carers’ experiences [36] as this approach centres on individuals ascribing meaning to their experiences in their interactions with the environment. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,IPA is a set of systematic processes that shift from phenomenological to interpretive while focusing on the participant’s perspective and understandings in different contexts [36]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"It is an iterative, inductive and flexible approach involving close reading and re-reading of transcripts while note-taking in margins, ‘bracketing’ the analyst’s critical perspective, recording critical and interpretive comments in a reflexive diary; re-reading the text and identifying codes and themes that best capture the essential qualities of that interview while also looking for connections between themes; revisiting earlier transcripts to re-consider data; clustering themes and concepts and developing an overall structure using excerpts from interviews; and re-assessing and revising new themes against earlier data [40]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"One researcher (AA) undertook preliminary analysis wherein transcripts were read, notes added to the document, and a coding system developed to elucidate categories. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"To facilitate rigor, a second researcher (EE) independently coded unmarked transcripts [41]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,The interviewers had frequent informal and formal discussions regarding code development and emerging findings with the lead cultural mentor (CC) who provided formative insights throughout the data collection and preliminary analysis period; divergences in the coding scheme were discussed until consensus was reached. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"The remaining interviews were coded according to the developed scheme, yet emergent categories were documented and considered throughout the analysis. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Categories were then collapsed into themes. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Preliminary and developed themes were discussed with the full project team prior to cessation of analysis and this was followed by another extensive discussion of key themes with the lead cultural mentor. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Transcript excerpts which supported each theme were copied into a Microsoft Word file along with supporting field notes. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"All supporting evidence was then considered, contextualised and written into an account illustrating participants’ experiences and perspectives [42]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"To further enhance credibility and trustworthiness, stakeholder checks were undertaken [41], whereby preliminary analysis of findings was presented to clinic staff, some of whom were also carers of an Aboriginal child with a disability. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Additional feedback from this group was incorporated into theme development. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Ethical considerations ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Ethical approval was granted by the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (AH&MRC) (762/10) and University of Technology Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (UTS HREC 2011-417R). ,"[['f Technology Sydney Human Research Ethics Com', 'Human', 'Organisms']]","[[137, 142, 'Human', 'OG']]"
PMC5134075,METHODS,The study adhered to key principles for research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as espoused by the AH&MRC. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Briefly, these included the involvement in and control of all research stages by the Aboriginal health service, direct consultation with members of the community affected by the research, reimbursement of expenses associated with participation, and intended outcomes that inform the design and delivery of needed culturally appropriate services for children and their families and are aimed at increasing the community’s knowledge of and ways to access support and services [43]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Confidentiality of discussions was assured and participants were advised that their care or status at the health service would be influenced neither by participation nor divulgence. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Permission to audio record interviews was obtained from each participant. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Names were replaced with pseudonyms and identifying information was removed following verbatim transcription of recordings. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Study findings are reported according to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research guidelines [44]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Availability of data and materials ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,The data supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article in the form of interview excerpts. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,Full interview transcripts remain the property of the participating Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organization. ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,The journey metaphor ,,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,"Pathways and journeys have increasingly been used to depict experiences of health conditions and service use as these terms reflect movement or progression, not always in a linear direction, but generally resulting in an accumulation or loss of knowledge or other resources over time [45]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,METHODS,We often refer to gaining new experience or skills as ‘going on a journey’. ,,[]

PMC5134075,RESULTS,Results ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Participants were 19 carers of Aboriginal children. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"They were all women, more than half of whom (n = 10) were lone carers (without a partner or spouse), and were taking care of 60 children at home, half of whom were identified as having a disability or developmental delay.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,"The majority of participants were the mothers of the children (n = 16), and three were grandmothers. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Factors that influenced carer journeys to access support and services reflected their interactions with community, service and policy levels. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Themes depicting these journeys included: need for increased signage via community education, information and awareness; wrong way signs, roundabouts and roadblocks encountered when accessing services; alternate routes can facilitate the journey; and the incompatibility of inflexible bureaucratic road rules and lived realities. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Need for ‘increased signage’ within communities via community education, information and awareness ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"The community, defined as an informal network of extended family, friends and other carers, played a key role in carers’ accessing support and services. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Due to this influence, carers emphasised the need for investment in building community capacity as a support mechanism through increased education, information and awareness. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Carers accessed advice and recommendations from community members on the developmental progress of children and available services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Some carers experienced tension between respecting community advice while knowing something is wrong with their child. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Community advice in this context is inclusive of cultural advice as identified by carers. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Advice by community members that there was nothing wrong with a child contributed to delays in seeking diagnoses and treatment. “Yeah, you let things slide. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"You just – it’s not that you don’t want to put the effort into it and go and sit around and take them out of school or anything like that, it’s just you’ve got your elder saying to you, “No, they’re right. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,They’re right. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Don’t worry about it. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"They’ll pick up in their own time,” and sometimes they don’t.” (Rita)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"The lack of community education, information and awareness around disability and available services evidently impeded access to support and services. “It’s not advertised that they have this other health service that’s provided for black kids… But yeah. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,It’s not known…That’s what my thing is…But how many other people are missing out?” (Laura)  ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Carer preferences to address this lack of clear direction and mapping were access to a local database of preferred providers and building a community of carers through support groups. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Carers identified that they would prefer to have the database and support groups organised and hosted through the local Aboriginal health service. “I think that that would be something that would be helpful for us to just be able to have some sort of connection to other families, in particular Aboriginal families…and whether the [Aboriginal health service] can, sort of, do that.” (Ainslee)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Wrong way signs, roundabouts and roadblocks encountered when accessing services ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Carers encountered a number of obstacles when attempting to access and interface with health and support services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Many carer journeys involved referrals to and interaction with multiple service providers including occupational therapists (OT), speech therapists, physiotherapists, paediatricians and GPs. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"In navigating this pathway independently, there were accounts of providers qualifying the extent of their service leading to inconsistent service access.“I would ring a private speech and private OT, and stuff and a lot of them would say, okay, but we don’t deal with children with significant disabilities… you need to go to your GP, and it would be like [laughs] a sort of a catch-22…It would just be round in circles…it just really wasn’t helpful at all.” (Ainslee)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Delays to assessment and treatment caused by long waitlists were a significant roadblock encountered by carers. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Long waitlists for needed procedures could lead to children missing school, lack of developmental progress and stress for carers. “And I said, I understand there is kids that are a lot worse than [child]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,I do understand that. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"It’s just, with this waiting list, he’d probably be able to speak by then, he wouldn’t even need it… And then I got upset, and I said to my mum, it’s like no-one’s out there that wants to help.” (Tabitha)  “Waiting and waiting for appointments, you know, like, nothing gets done straight away…it’s just such a long process…I am no closer now than I was then. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,That’s the frustrating part about it.” (Nadia)  ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Only one carer expressed lack of concern regarding waitlists stating that they are a “part of life” (Rita). ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Contributing to this acceptance was contextualizing the carers’ own situation against the belief that there is always someone whose need is greater. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Lack of follow-up led to children falling through the treatment gap due to missed opportunities for timely access to support and services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,In one case an initial needs assessment generated a list of required therapeutic interventions for one child but no follow-up contact was made to link the carer with the required services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Despite the carer following-up there had been no additional contact made with her or consolidation of these supports. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Carers identified that lack of follow-up was also sometimes due to clerical errors.“We went and had the very first assessment where [government service] said, yeah, she needs OT, she needs speech, she needs physio and we never heard from them again. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"It was, sort of, like…they would ring us and – and, um, say that, you know, we’re still, sort of, on the waiting list…and it got to two years and we’d, sort of, had nothing…I spoke to them and they, sort of, said, well we’ll find out what’s happening and it just, sort of, never eventuated.” (Ainslee)  “I thought I signed everything and I thought everything got faxed through.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Actually, everything got faxed through to [children’s hospital] and they, um, lost the paper and then it had to be re-faxed through. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"So, yeah and I had to re-sign all the papers. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Not much – like I didn’t know much about that then because I thought everything was going ahead, going through, thought everything was fine.” (Samantha)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Lack of assistance from service providers impeded attempts at accessing support and services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Carers described a lack of assistance in seeking funding for services such as teachers aids as well as in managing behavioural problems. ,"[['es such as teachers aids as well as in manag', 'aids', 'Diseases'], [' teachers aids as well as in managing behavioural problems.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,This had a significant impact on the health and well-being of some carers. “He was more or less going to be a forgotten child and if he didn’t keep up his grades they weren’t going to keep him back but they weren’t going to give him no more help…. but it had me at breaking point where I really felt like I was having a nervous breakdown. ,"[['ally felt like I was having a nervous breakdown.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,Some carers described having to begin the journey hours well in advance of appointments if referrals were made to geographically distant areas. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Caring for more than one child with a disability added another layer of complexity for carers especially if the children attended separate schools. “So they wanted me, pick her up and then bring her here, drop her off. ",,[]

PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Pick up the boys, you go to the school, oh no, we can’t do that.” (Helen)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,The extra cost of using taxis caused additional stress for carers. ,"[['extra cost of using taxis caused additional s', 'taxis', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Carers who used public transport to avoid this cost experienced difficulty with managing children, especially when they required a stroller or wheelchair. ","[['ers who used public transport to avoid this cost ', 'transport', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Addressing these roadblocks was particularly important in facilitating access to assessment services in order to get a diagnosis. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Without a diagnosis it was difficult for carers to access support and services.“The school actually told me that they would not help until [child] did have an MRI to see if there was something wrong because I’ll quote the words of the principal, “He is like he has got a locked door and we cannot find the key to open it.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Until we find the key to open it, we cannot do no more with him. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,We just have to leave that door locked”.” (Rita)  ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"For some carers, obtaining a diagnosis to access support and services was influenced by whether their child’s condition was acute or non-acute. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Comparison of carer journeys suggest that children with more acute conditions fit better into the streamlined medical model of care compared to children who have non-acute conditions which are not as severe or easy to diagnose. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Alternate routes can facilitate the journey ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"In the face of roadblocks, alternate routes in the form of models of care that differ to the Western bio-medical approach and supportive administrative staff and organisation procedures enabled carers to access support and services. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"A model of care that viewed the needs of the child and carer holistically, provided a one-stop-shop and implemented a centralised team-based approach was identified as important by a number of carers. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Many carers accessed this alternate route to support and services through local Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs), yet access was limited. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Providing support and services through a holistic lens was essential for carers as a broad range of personal and environmental factors influence the experience of caring for a child with a disability and the ability to access support and services. “This is why I keep coming back here, because they were fantastic.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Um, they help me with getting some counselling…” (Jocelyn)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,The convenience of a one-stop-shop and centralised team-based approach was also important. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"At a local Aboriginal health service convenience was ensured by holding all health records in one place, linking appointments with different internal services so they were scheduled in close succession, and acting as a conduit to external services when required. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Supportive administrative staff and organisation procedures facilitated carer access to support and services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Key administrative personnel were identified as important to facilitative organisation procedures. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"One carer reported that a former manager used to make sure that “everyone was doing what they were supposed to be doing” (Helen), however when the staff member left the organisation, this carer had difficulty reaching the service by phone. ",,[]

PMC5134075,RESULTS,Incompatibility of inflexible bureaucratic road rules and lived realities ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Policies guiding government agencies and funding bodies have far reaching effects on carer journeys to access support and services. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Many carer interactions with government agencies were defined by barriers generated from inflexible rules and bureaucratic processes. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Carers’ accounts indicated that the lived reality of caring for a child with a disability is not supported or acknowledged by current policy and this negatively impacted their experiences and ability to care for their child. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Carers described incidents where agencies were unable to accommodate their specific needs due to inflexible rules. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Accessing financial assistance from Centrelink to assist with caregiving related responsibilities was particularly difficult due to rigid eligibility criteria. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"This had implications for carer employment and support payments. “…the Carer’s Allowance loan was supposed to be coming up, and I wanted to pay the rest of it off to get another loan for [children’s hospital], because I have to pay for an overnight stay with her, and for one of these tests I have to pay for it.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,And my appointment is on the 25 th .” (Lesley)  ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,The Department of Housing (DoH) was another government agency many carers interacted with which was also defined by inflexible rules. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Carers described DoH expectations of clients caring for a child with a disability as inappropriate. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"The strict requirements for obtaining housing assistance can negatively impact carers accessing support and services for their child with the lack of assistance perceived as dismissiveness.“…they still wanted me to look for, for pretty much three houses a day, um, um and I’ve got no personal transport…I told the Department of Housing, you know, “You are expecting me to drag my daughter around with a disability to look for houses.” They wanted – they said they wanted me to go out to [suburb 1] and everything.

PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Like [suburb 2], and then I said, “Like why would I go out to [suburb 2] when my family is in [suburb 3]?”…and I’m like, “Yeah, but I can’t live in [suburb 2] or [suburb 1] or anywhere I have no support,” and they were like, “Oh well, it doesn’t matter, as long as, um, you get a house”.” (Samantha)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,Bureaucratic requirements of government funding mechanisms and support services reinforce rigid eligibility criteria that mean some children don’t receive the support they require. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"The rigid eligibility criteria of age-based funding structures was identified as an issue influencing the quality of specialists that children with a disability have access to. “So yep, it doesn’t help a lot of the families that have the younger kids and that’s why - and I’ve always said that that’s why they don’t get seen to the right people because of the financial cost of that.” (Grace)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"Rigid eligibility criteria for accessible Aboriginal education officers (AEOs), who act as liaison and support workers within schools, also impacted partnerships between schools and carers. ",,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,One school did not have the required percentage of Aboriginal children to qualify for a dedicated AEO. ,,[]
PMC5134075,RESULTS,"For this carer it was important to have access to the support of an AEO as they play an important support role to the carer getting across their point of view as a third party in the school-carer partnership. “So, yeah, it’s not feeling like you’re ganged up on, kind of thing.” (Rita)  ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Discussion ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Carers’ descriptions of their attempts to access support for their child with a disability were akin to a journey: sometimes they did not know where to go (as a result of poor signage), they went around in circles, in the wrong direction, had to make u-turns and encountered roadblocks and traffic. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"For many who set out on a journey, they eventually arrive at a destination, but these carers were still traveling, as caring for a child with a disability is a lifelong voyage. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Some carers received directional assistance along the way; people who unlocked gates and facilitated access to needed resources. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"For instance, the role of community both facilitated and obfuscated carers’ service access. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Community influence has likewise been identified in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) carers wherein extended family and community members sometimes presented a barrier to access by denying presence of a disability [49]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Another Australian study of CALD carers’ perceptions of preventive health care for their children found that social influence plays a key role in identification of developmental problems and the need to access services [50]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"In their review of vulnerable groups access to healthcare, Dixon-Woods et al. [51] found that people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to present for services due to the normalization of poor health within their communities and a fear of being ‘blamed’ by health care professionals [51]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Rather than not recognizing the need to get help, the ‘wait and see’ approach advised by some community members may reflect the Aboriginal world view of health [52] whereby disability is ‘part of a continuum from perfect wellbeing to death’ [32] compared to the more narrow medical definition. ","[['erfect wellbeing to death’ [32] compared to', 'death', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Gilroy et al. [53] assert that labeling individuals as disabled is offensive to some Aboriginal communities and associated with past government policies that led to removal of children from families [53]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"It is also suggested that in some Aboriginal communities support and care for a person with a disability is viewed as the responsibility of family and kinship networks and outside help viewed as questioning family competence [22, 53]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Despite impacting carer access to services, the resilience and strength of Aboriginal communities in caring for each other represents a key resource that requires investment. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Community capacity can be built by increasing ‘signage’ via community education, information and awareness of disability and services. ",,[]

PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Having to wait months to access services and confusion caused by interaction with multiple service providers has also been found in an Australian study of the experiences of CALD carers accessing developmental assessment services [49] suggesting the widespread nature of these barriers. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Roadblocks are particularly concerning as accessing assessment services to obtain a diagnosis is essential in being able to access support and services [54]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Removing those barriers may help patients seek and access the medical care they need. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Dedicated patient navigators may be a solution to overcome these barriers by bridging the gap between carers and the various service systems involved [55]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"A patient navigator is akin to a tour guide who assists patients to navigate their way through complex systems, helping to remove patient-level barriers to reduce delays in accessing services [56, 57]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"The patient navigator model can be a key ‘weapon’ against health disparities that certain groups face [56, 58]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,A study of the experiences of Aboriginal patients with cancer accessing diagnosis and treatment found that a patient navigator model would help facilitate mainstream service access for patients [59]. ,"[['ginal patients with cancer accessing diagnosis', 'cancer', 'Diseases']]","[[55, 61, 'cancer', 'DS']]"
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Involving Aboriginal liaison officers in these roles is a way to foster cultural security [60]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Focus groups with key stakeholders and Aboriginal carers have also identified that patient navigators in the form of dedicated disability support workers within Aboriginal health services would help in raising awareness of available support and services for families [21]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"While a patient navigator could help carers to by-pass roadblocks at the service level, responsive service systems are critical to the model’s efficacy. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Responsive services systems that are informed by the views of both carers and the workforces responsible for service delivery, especially the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce, are important to understanding the needs of carers and developing responsive strategies to address them [61].

PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Guiding principles for responsive service systems include sharing ownership and responsibility for change, responding to the needs of families in the context of where they live, as well as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce, working together from the micro to macro levels, and building on the existing strengths of families and relevant workforces [61].

PMC5134075,DISCUSS,The use of alternate routes or service models is important. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Future planning of service and support models should consider the elements identified by carers as most important including a holistic view of the needs of the child and carer, one-stop-shop for services and operationalizing a centralized team-based approach. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,These elements are typically embodied in the model of care provided by ACCHOs and argued to be a vital part of improving health and wellbeing outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples [62]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,The incompatibility between inflexible bureaucratic policy requirements and the demands and challenges of caring for a child with a disability was a significant part of carer journeys. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Meeting inflexible requirements for eligibility to respite services and funding has elsewhere been described as ‘jumping through hoops’ [54]. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"Given the multiple complex needs of these families and frequent interaction with government departments, Butler et al. [55] recommend that modification of inflexible policy requirements is essential if design of policies and programs are to improve service access for parents in vulnerable families [55]. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Limitations ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Participants were purposefully sampled in order to facilitate in-depth exploration of their experiences. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"However, self-selection bias along with a small sample size means that these findings are not necessarily generalizable to other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations or to indigenous populations globally. ",,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,All data were self-reported reflecting carers’ individual experiences and perspectives. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Further research into the experiences of service providers would help contribute to a more comprehensive picture of barriers and facilitators to service access. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,Follow-up interviews were conducted within a 12 month period despite more prolonged service access journeys. ,,[]
PMC5134075,DISCUSS,"All participants in this study were women, hence the perspectives of male carers is needed. ",,[]

PMC4237798,DISCUSS,Discussion ,,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study using DTI to observe secondary changes in the left frontal white matter remote from the ipsilateral posterior corona radiata. ",,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"Previous studies have shown that focal cerebral infarcts can lead to remote tissue alterations within connected regions related to Wallerian degeneration [8],[10],[18]–[21]. ","[['ve shown that focal cerebral infarcts can lead to remote ', 'cerebral infarcts', 'Diseases']]","[[39, 56, 'cerebral infarcts', 'DS']]"
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"Because computed tomography (CT) and traditional MRI are insufficiently sensitive and difficult to quantify the microstructural changes, DTI was used in this study. ",,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"DTI is able to characterize brain tissue structure by measurement of water diffusion, expressed as two indices, MD and FA. ","[['e by measurement of water diffusion, expresse', 'water', 'Chemicals']]","[[69, 74, 'water', 'CD']]"
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,MD is a parameter of magnitude of average molecular motion considered in all directions. ,,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,FA is a quantitative measure of directional bias in the diffusion profile. ,,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"A significant increase of MD and decrease of FA in the left frontal white matter was found between W1 and W12, but there were no significant changes between W1 and W4, and between W4 and W12. ",,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,The abnormal diffusion observed suggest that the secondary damage is cumulative from W1 to W12. ,,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"Such changes in MD and FA in the frontal white matter have also been described in patients with ILA, which is suggestive of axonal structural loss in the regions [6]. ",,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"Also, the increased MD and decrease of FA may be correlated with executive functional changes. ",,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"Frontal-subcortical circuit was defined as including the frontal cortex, caudate, pallidum, thalamus, genu of internal capsule, anterior internal capsule, anterior corona radiata, and anterior centrum semiovale [3].

PMC4237798,DISCUSS,A possible explanation for this is that the region itself is a structure in the executive functional circuit. ,,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,Another more possible mechanism of the executive changes in the patients is secondary degeneration due to the disruption of axons in the frontal white matter that links the frontal cortex to other structures in the executive functional circuit. ,"[['o the disruption of axons in the frontal whit', 'axons', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,The correlation of MD and FA alteration in the left posterior white matter with executive performance supports this hypothesis. ,,[]

PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"A weak correlation between the MD changes in the left thalamus and executive function was found in this study, which means secondary damage of the left thalamus is possibly involved in inhibiting executive function. ",,[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,The lack of FA changes may be related to the absence of isolated bundles of parallel fibers within the thalamus [14]. ,"[['isolated bundles of parallel fibers within the thalamus', 'parallel fibers', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,We failed to find significant diffusion changes in the posterior periventricular white matter or centrum semiovale. ,,[]

PMC4237798,DISCUSS,Longer follow-up and more sophisticated image analysis techniques may be required for determining secondary damage in other regions remote to an infarction. ,"[[' damage in other regions remote to an infarction. ', 'infarction', 'Diseases']]","[[145, 155, 'infarction', 'DS']]"
PMC4237798,DISCUSS,"In our patients, there was no abnormal signal in the frontal area at W1 and W12, which means no new ischemic lesions exist in the frontal area between W1 and W12. ",,[]

PMC5528876,METHODS,SPSS 17.00 for Windows was used for general statistical analyses. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Mean differences between subgroups are expressed in Cohen’s d and considered large if > .80, moderate between .50 and .79 and small between .20 and .49 [62]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,In calculating means we limited missing values to one for all subscales and two for total mean scores. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Test-retest reliability was established by intraclass correlation (ICC). ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,ICC > .75 was considered as excellent and between .40 and .75 as acceptable [63]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Construct validity was investigated by correlations. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"We expected a moderate correlation of body image total score with body satisfaction, because the DBIQ is aimed to measure a broader concept of body image. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,We also expected moderate correlations of body image total score with self-esteem and psychological well-being. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Furthermore, high correlations are expected between the subscale ‘vitality’ of the DBIQ-NL and fatigue as measured with the CIS and between the ‘physical contact’ subscale of the DBIQ-NL and the comfort in touch subscale of the BIS. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,The factorial structure of the translated version was tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). ,"[['ted by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). ', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[94, 97, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Analyses were conducted with Mplus Version 5.1 [64], using the robust full-information maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator to correct for the skew distribution of several items and missing item responses [65]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"In view of the sufficiently large sample size and focus on model selection and fit, the 5-point Likert items were treated as continuous measures [66]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Complete descriptives for all items used for the CFA are provided in S2 Table. ,"[[' items used for the CFA are provided in S2 ', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[49, 52, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Because a five factor model was shown to be adequate for the German questionnaire, we investigated the fit of this model to the Dutch samples, aiming to obtain fit measures close to those of the German model. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,We could not reasonably expect equivalent fit measures as the study is not an exact replication study. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"The three essential changes with respect to Pöhlmann et al.’s [26] study, (1) translation of the items, (2) non-clinical samples, and (3) using a CFA model without correlated errors, were expected to lead to a decrease in model fit [67, 68]. ","[['es, and (3) using a CFA model without corre', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[146, 149, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Because each type of index provides different information about model fit [69], we chose to report a broad range of indices and also included standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and Tucker Lewis index (TLI), in addition to the CFI and RMSEA reported in the CFA on the German items [26]. ","[['SEA reported in the CFA on the German items', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[267, 270, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,METHODS,The RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) represents the fit of the estimated covariance matrix to the populations covariance matrix [70]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,It is regarded as one of the most informative fit indices due to its sensitivity to the number of estimated parameters in the model and therefore favouring parsimonious models. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"As a rule of thumb, RMSEA values less than .08 suggest adequate model fit and RMSEA values less than .05 suggest good model fit [71]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,The SRMR (Standardised Root Mean square Residual) is the standardized square root of the difference between the residuals of the sample covariance matrix and the hypothesised covariance model. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,An SRMR between .05 and .10 indicates an acceptable fit and values less than .05 indicate good fit [72]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,The CFI (Comparitive Fit Index) [73] compares the sample covariance matrix with a null model of uncorrelated latent variables. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"The CFI is one of the most commonly reported fit indices due to being one of the measures least effected by sample size and is often reported together with the TLI (Tucker Lewis Index), a comparative fit index slightly differing from the CFI in its approach to sample size and handling of the effect of model complexity [69]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,CFI and TLI values in the range between .90 and .95 may be regarded as indicative of acceptable model fit [69]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Although there is discussion on which fit-indices are the most relevant, it is now common practice to test the fit of the CFA with at least the ones used here. ","[['test the fit of the CFA with at least the o', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[122, 125, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Thus, conclusions about the fit of the model can be based on the consistency between fit-indices. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"When fit-indices fall in marginal ranges, it is especially important to consider the consistency of the model fit as expressed by the various types of fit indices in tandem with the particular aspects of the analytic situation [69]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Inadequate fit measures are an indication of model misspecification. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Modification indices can be used to adjust the model specification in order to improve model fit. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"First, the five-factor model (without correlated errors) was estimated, using sample 1. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Modification indices were inspected to detect possible improvements with respect to dimensionality. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"We refrained from including correlated errors in view of the multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA), which does not allow correlated errors. ","[['factor analysis (MG-CFA), which does not al', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[109, 112, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,METHODS,"We performed multiple-group analyses with respect to gender and age after investigating the overall five-factor structure of the DBIQ-NL, because MG-CFA provides the opportunity to identify items that are non-invariant across groups. ","[['DBIQ-NL, because MG-CFA provides the opport', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[149, 152, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Invariance is a prerequisite for individual and group comparisons to reflect true differences [69, 74], not due to systematic differences in interpretation of items due to respondents’ group membership. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,The extent of measurement invariance was evaluated in a series of three models. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"In model A, specifying ‘configural invariance’, the same factor structure is imposed on the two groups (formed by either sex or age)In the next model (B), specifying ‘weak invariance’, the factor loadings are constrained to be equal across groups. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"In Model C, ‘strong invariance’, the factor loadings and intercepts are constrained to be equal across groups. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,The model selection was performed by testing invariance by the Scaled Difference in Chi-Squares (SDCS) test [75] for nested models estimated with MLR. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Inspection of size and consistency of factor loadings were performed to further evaluate model fit [69]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,This sequential model estimation procedure to study measurement invariance is used since lack of strong factorial invariance will contaminate estimates of group mean differences [74]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"It is widely acknowledged however, that the requirement of strong factorial invariance may be too strict and unrealistic a goal for group comparisons. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Consequently, Byrne et al. [76] introduced the concept of partial invariance in which only a subset of parameters in each subscale must be invariant whereas others are allowed to vary between the groups. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"In this procedure, fit diagnostics (e.g., modification indices) can assist the researcher to identify specific items that are non-invariant across groups [69]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,In our analysis partial invariance was investigated by inspecting modification indices to determine which cross-group equality constraint most significantly contributed to lack of fit; the model was re-estimated after freeing that constraint and this process was reiterated as needed [77]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,Partial invariance of certain items signals qualitative group differences that render exact between-group comparisons with respect to subscales including these items possibly less meaningful. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,The importance of any violation of factorial invariance should be judged in relation to the intended use of the measure in practice [78] and may also be dependent on the number of affected items. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,The implications of the findings with respect to measurement invariance are further investigated by comparing the original (sub-)scale scores to the adjusted (sub-)scale scores. ,,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Moreover, the correlations between the full and reduced scale and subscales were investigated, as well as the change in standardized factor loadings. ",,[]
PMC5528876,METHODS,"Note that all (sub-)scale scores are calculated as average scores, which are unweighted and therefore not affected by (changes in) factor loadings. ",,[]

PMC5528876,RESULTS,Table 2 presents total mean scores and standard deviations in both DBIQ-NL samples as well as means and standard deviations for the questionnaires used for validation. ,,[]

PMC5528876,RESULTS,The same holds true for the model fits constraining factor loadings and intercepts to be equal across the two age groups: a model fit with only factor loadings constrained (2aB) leads to a non-significant increase in chi square. ,,[]

PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Discussion ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Structure of the (sub)scales ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,The aim of this study was to assess psychometric properties of the DBIQ in a non-clinical Dutch sample. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Moreover, the work done by the developers of the original scale [26, 27] was extended by evaluating the equivalence of the measurement model across sex and age. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,For our evaluation of the psychometric properties we used a large convenience sample with a gender and age distribution deviating from the Dutch general population. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Whereas the investigation of age invariance of the DBIQ was in fact facilitated by the bimodal age distribution, the sample does not provide information on the distribution of DBIQ scores across the general population (e.g. with the purpose of computing norm scores). ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Confirmatory Factor Analysis based on the five-factor structure of the original German questionnaire, showed adequate fit in the translated version for RMSEA and SRMR, but mediocre fit for CFI and TLI [69]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Adaptation of the model based on inspection of the modification indices led to improvement of model fit. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"In this adaptation, the item “I like showing my body” was moved from the subscale body acceptance to the subscale self-aggrandizement. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"This is in line with the results of the principal component analysis by Probst et al. [34], which revealed higher loadings on the subscale self-aggrandizement for the item “I like showing my body” than on the original subscale. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Even though German and Dutch are closely related languages, a slight semantic difference may have occurred, suggesting that the Dutch translation emphasizes the pleasure of showing one’s body, whereas the original item was meant to measure body acceptance. ","[['ting that the Dutch translation emphasizes the plea', 'translation', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,A semantic explanation is more plausible than a cultural difference in the interpretation of this item. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Based on the fit indices and considering that reallocating one item is an acceptable model change when an instrument is used in a different cultural setting or language [61], the adapted model was used for further evaluations. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"After comparing the quality of the goodness of fit indices, as recommended by [79], with findings from previous research based on the German inventory, we judge the psychometric properties of the DBIQ-NL as sufficient to warrant further research on the scale and its properties, in a Dutch clinical population. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"While being aware of new developments in scale analysis by Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling to remedy the overly strict CFA requirements [68, 80], we refrained from applying this method in order to obtain a close comparison between the DBIQ-NL and the original DBIQ by following a similar evaluation procedure. ","[['y the overly strict CFA requirements [68, 8', 'CFA', 'Gene_Proteins']]","[[128, 131, 'CFA', 'GP']]"
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Based on [67, 79], it was to be expected that the DBIQ-NL would show a reduced goodness of fit compared to the original scale, in which the reported CFI only just met the often used threshold of 0.90. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,A multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis showed configural invariance. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"The equal item intercepts hypothesis, implying factorial invariance, however, was not supported for all subscales across sex and age. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"When testing partial factorial invariance, four items were identified that contributed to the lack of strong invariance across sex (item 19, 30) or age (item 28) or across both groups (item 15) indicating that interpretation of the meaning of these items and therefore the item scores might depend on group membership. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Replication of the procedure by fitting a final model in sample 1 without these items supported the best, although moderate, fit of this 31-item scale. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Next to the technical identification of these differing items, there are arguments from a qualitative perspective as to why these items differ across groups. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Some items suggest interesting patterns. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"In items 19 and 30, differing across sex, being touched by others is the central issue. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,These items may be interpreted differently by men and women since the latter are more often the object of undesired physical contact. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Invariance across sex in item 15 (“I choose clothing that hides the shape of my body”) could be explained by the fact that for men, in contrast to women, clothing is not a well-known strategy to camouflage less accepted parts of the body [81]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,The differences across age for this item might be indicative for age- or cohort-related cultural differences with regard to showing the body. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Item 28 (“If I could change something about my body, I would do it”) might mean something different for the older age group, in light of physical impairments or other confrontations with unwelcome bodily changes. ","[[' group, in light of physical impairments or other confrontat', 'physical impairments', 'Diseases']]","[[137, 157, 'physical impairments', 'DS']]"
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Millsap and Kwok [78] describe the option of using a shortened version of the scale that omits the items that performed differently across groups, at the same time warning that this option results in as many versions of the scale as there are invariance studies. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,A second option is to retain all items when the net impact of the differences on the total score is small [78]. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,This is indeed the case in the present non-clinical sample. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Also due to the limited number of affected items, partial invariance only slightly affects the differences between sex and age groups in mean total scores on the DBIQ-NL and subscales. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Therefore, adaptations need not be made when the scale is used to gain global information on body image in non-clinical groups. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"However, when the focus is on gathering information with respect to differences on the issue of physical contact across the sexes or on the theme of body acceptance among different age groups, a score without the items violating invariance could be relevant. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Reliability and validity ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,The DBIQ-NL and its five subscales showed adequate internal consistency. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Test-retest reliability was also adequate, although based on a rather small sample. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Good construct validity was found with moderate associations with body satisfaction (BCS) as expected since the DBIQ aims to measure a broad concept of body image whereas in the BCS appearance-related issues are prominent. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"The higher correlations between total score on the DBIQ and body satisfaction (BCS) for men than for women can possibly be explained by this difference since earlier studies found that women are likely to give a greater emphasis than men to appearance as part of the concept body image [30, 82]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"The moderate associations between the DBIQ-NL and the OQ-45 and RSES confirm the relation between body image, psychosocial well-being and self-esteem and its importance when assessing non-clinical samples [5, 6]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Correlations between the subscales were relatively small, providing support for the multidimensionality of the instrument. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Validation of the subscales for physical contact and vitality by correlating these with other indices showed good construct validity. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Implications for the use of the DBIQ-NL and further research ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,The present study on the psychometric properties of the DBIQ in a Dutch non-clinical sample shows a factor structure and model fit that are satisfactory and motivate further study. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"In view of our aim to make an instrument available in Dutch language measuring body image as a multifaceted construct in a non-clinical as well as in a clinical population, future research will have to address a variety of clinical samples. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,These further evaluations should also pay attention to measurement invariance across sex and age. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Another issue of importance in clinical samples is the intimate and for a substantial group of patients possibly trauma related nature of the subscale sexual fulfillment. ,"[['f patients possibly trauma related nature of t', 'trauma', 'Diseases']]","[[113, 119, 'trauma', 'DS']]"
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Applicability of this subscale still needs to be evaluated. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"On the other hand, because both clinicians and patients seem to be reluctant to discuss issues concerning sexuality, a reluctance that may also be related to cultural or religious background, addressing sexuality in a self-report questionnaire may also make it easier for both client and therapist to pay attention to this relevant theme [28]. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"A recent study using the DBIQ-NL in a broad clinical sample including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders [83] gave a first indication of the clinical usefulness of the scale.

PMC5528876,DISCUSS,Body acceptance and sexual fulfillment were the most differentiating aspects of body image between diagnoses. ,,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,"Surprisingly, vitality did not differ significantly between the various disorders. ",,[]
PMC5528876,DISCUSS,It may be concluded that the DBIQ has potential surplus value in the field of body image since it covers a broad range of body image dimensions and includes important dimensions such as touch and sexuality that are not well represented in other measures of body image. ,,[]

PMC5306324,ABS,"Recent research has reported that lower maximal rate of torque development (dτ/dt max) exhibited by females, relative to males, during knee extension can be accounted for by normalization to a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC); however, this was not seen in the upper limb.

PMC5306324,INTRO,Introduction ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"The rate of tension development has received increased attention as a critical aspect of dynamic muscle performance during activities of daily living (e.g., balance maintenance) and sport performance (Aagaard et al. 2002; LaRoche et al. 2010; Paasuke et al. 2001; Pijnapples et al. 2008; Schultz et al. 1997; Tillin et al. 2013). ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,A number of studies have shown that there is an inextricable link between the ultimate strength of the muscle and its rate of tension development (Andersen and Aagaard 2006; Holtermann et al. 2007). ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"However, neural factors can also play an important role, as training-related increases in the maximal rate of tension development are associated with an increase in muscle activation at the onset of contraction (Van Cutsem et al. 1998; Van Cutsem and Duchateau 2005). ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,Inglis et al. (2013) recently showed that neural factors also play a role in sex-differences in the maximal rate of tension development in the upper limb. ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,Maximum strength was used as a covariate and was only able to account for a portion of the sex-differences. ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"The addition of a second variable, the maximum rate of electromyographic (EMG) activity at the onset of contraction (Q30), was able to eliminate statistically significant sex-differences. ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"Given the inherent relationship between muscle strength and the maximum rate of tension development, few studies have explored additional mechanisms that would explain sex-differences in the maximal rate of tension development (Aagaard et al. 2002; Andersen and Aagaard 2006; Folland et al. 2014; Van Cutsem et al. 1998). ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"However, sex-differences in lower extremity musculoskeletal injury rates (DiStefano et al. 2015) and falls incidences (Hess and Woollacott 2005; Stevens and Sogolow 2005) may be linked back to this critical aspect of muscle contraction (Bento et al. 2010). ","[[' critical aspect of muscle contraction (Bento et al. 2010)', 'muscle contraction', 'Gene Ontology']]",[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"Hannah et al. (2012) explored potential neural and biomechanical factors involved in sex-differences in the maximal rate of tension development in the quadriceps, in addition to maximum strength. ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"Twitch properties, electromechanical delay, and muscle activation using surface EMG (sEMG) were also assessed. ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"Consistent with the more general findings for the relationship between maximum strength and the rate of tension development, when the peak rate of tension development was normalized with respect to maximum isometric strength of the muscle, the sex-differences were completely eliminated. ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,The results by Hannah et al. (2012) in the lower limb are contrary to the finding of Inglis et al. (2013) who showed a role for neural factors in the upper limb. ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"It may be hypothesized that since males and females were more comparable in absolute strength in the quadriceps (Δ33%) than the biceps (Δ55.5%; Inglis et al. 2013), strength may entirely explain sex-differences in the rate of tension development in the lower limb. ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"In contrast, the difference in maximum strength between males and females in the upper limb observed by Inglis et al. (2013) was much greater (Δ55.5%), possibly allowing for additional factors, such as the rate of muscle activation, to play a role. ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,Inglis et al. (2013) explored the possibility that the interpretation of the results may differ based on normalization to maximum voluntary strength versus the use of a covariate approach. ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,It was found that normalization to maximum voluntary strength also failed to account for all sex-differences in the maximal rate of tension development. ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"Since there is a strong relationship between maximum strength and the rate of tension development, sex-differences may be accounted for by maximum strength only when the two groups are ‘more’ comparable with respect to maximal strength as exists in the lower limb compared with the upper limb. ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"For example, it has been shown that males and females are more comparable in maximal isometric dorsiflexion strength (Δ28.9%) and identical with respect to root-mean-square (RMS) sEMG magnitude (Heyward et al. 1986; Hoffman et al. 1979; Lenhardt et al. 2009). ",,[]

PMC5306324,INTRO,The 28.9% strength difference between the sexes is consistent with Holmbäck et al. (2003) who concluded that muscle cross-sectional area was the principal determinant of dorsiflexion strength. ,,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,"In general, the muscle cross-sectional area of the TA in males is only 20% larger than that for females (Holmbäck et al. 2003; Jaworowski et al. 2002). ",,[]
PMC5306324,INTRO,The purpose of this paper was to determine if sex-differences in the maximum rate of isometric dorsiflexion torque development are determined by maximum isometric dorsiflexion torque alone or other factors as observed for the upper limb where the strength differences are more pronounced. ,"[['metric dorsiflexion torque development are det', 'torque', 'Chemicals'], ['metric dorsiflexion torque alone or other fact', 'torque', 'Chemicals']]","[[108, 114, 'torque', 'CD']]"

PMC5306324,DISCUSS,There also were no significant differences between males and females in sEMG RMS amplitude magnitude as observed by Lenhardt et al. (2009). ,,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"The absence of sex-differences in the sEMG signal amplitude, Vpp, and CT may reflect a comparable number of hours per week of training for the two groups (Aagaard et al. 2002). ",,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,Contraction time was used in the study to determine if differences in the maximal rate of torque development were associated with either descending voluntary control or peripheral factors associated with muscle composition (Close 1972). ,"[['the maximal rate of torque development were as', 'torque', 'Chemicals']]","[[90, 96, 'torque', 'CD']]"
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"Based on the fact, no sex-related differences in the CT (0.01%) were found suggests that the two groups were also similar with respect to muscle fiber composition, which is consistent with other research (Hicks and McCartney 1996). ",,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"Based on the work of Lenhardt et al. (2009), it was expected that males and females would be more comparable in maximum strength in the lower limb than the upper limb, which is consistent with other studies on sex-differences in maximum strength (Heyward et al. 1986; Hoffman et al. 1979). ",,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"Instead, a 50.6% difference was observed, which was the same order of magnitude as previously observed for the upper limb (Inglis et al. 2013). ",,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,One reason may be related to differences in the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the TA in the present sample versus that of Lenhardt et al. (2009). ,,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"Although CSA was not directly measured, the males and females in this study had a larger difference in lower leg girth (8.4%) than the 5.2% observed by Lenhardt et al. (2009), which may suggest a larger difference in TA CSA. ",,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,The large difference in maximum strength between males and females was associated with a comparably large difference in the maximum rate of isometric dorsiflexion torque development (44.6%). ,"[['metric dorsiflexion torque development (44.6%)', 'torque', 'Chemicals']]","[[163, 169, 'torque', 'CD']]"
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,Greater co-activation of the antagonist muscle group in females could contribute to both lower maximum strength and rate of torque development. ,"[['imum strength and rate of torque development. ', 'torque', 'Chemicals']]","[[124, 130, 'torque', 'CD']]"
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"Macaluso et al. (2002) showed that females may use greater antagonist co-activation to stabilize the joint due to greater joint laxity, smaller agonist musculature, and potentially lower quality muscle mass (torque/CSA), as has been seen in older versus younger adults (Solomonow et al. 1988; Thelen et al. 1996).

PMC5306324,DISCUSS,There were several novel findings in this study. ,,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"First, there were no significant differences between males and females with respect to MFCV. ",,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"This result may be due to comparable muscle fiber diameters between the sexes, which is a large determinant of MFCV (Lange et al. 2002; Lindstrom and Magnusson 1977; Merletti et al. 1995; Nishihara et al. 2005; Zwarts 1989). ",,[]

PMC5306324,DISCUSS,"The small interelectrode distance (5 mm) will record from a small pick-up volume that encapsulates these superficial type I fibers of the TA, which are comparable in muscle fiber diameter between the sexes. ",,[]

PMC5306324,DISCUSS,Females were significantly greater than males with respect to the rate of muscle activation as assessed by Q30. ,,[]
PMC5306324,DISCUSS,The difference increased further (4%) with repeated testing. ,,[]

PMC5306324,CONCL,Conclusion ,,[]
PMC5306324,CONCL,The results support the work of Hannah et al.

PMC5306324,CONCL,"This was true, even though the difference in maximal strength was quite pronounced (50.6%). ",,[]
PMC5306324,CONCL,"Thus, the hypothesis that maximum strength accounts for sex-differences in the maximum rate of tension development in the lower limb due solely to the fact that males and females are more comparable in maximum strength than in the upper limb was not supported. ",,[]
PMC5306324,CONCL,"Rather, the maximum strength accounted for sex-difference in the maximum rate of tension development despite a large discrepancy in strength between males and females. ",,[]

PMC6032655,UNK,Radiological Classification ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,There is a growing body of literature describing findings and techniques that may be used to distinguish renal AMLs. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,A lack of a generally accepted and standardized terminology or classification of AML fuels the persisting confusion. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"In this review, a radiological classification reported by two groups of authors will be discussed. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,A recent article hypothesized that renal AMLs can be classified according to CT and MRI findings using quantitative values. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"They classified these tumours as fat-rich, fat-poor, or fat- invisible, based on the amount of fat detected on imaging studies. ","[['ey classified these tumours as fat-rich, fat-po', 'tumours', 'Diseases']]","[[22, 29, 'tumours', 'DS']]"
PMC6032655,UNK,"To distinguish these different types, a region of interest (ROI) was placed in the most hypodense area of the lesion to measure the attenuation value. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,A lesion was defined as fat-rich when the ROI measured ≤ –10 Hounsfield units (HU) on unenhanced CT (UECT). ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"However, UECT could not differentiate fat-poor from fat-invisible AML. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,Therefore chemical shift imaging (CSI) MRI was introduced. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,This modality provides a higher sensitivity for fat detection than UECT. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"As in UECT, the most signal-dropped area was detected and a ROI was placed within. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"On CSI-MRI, fat-poor AML was characterized when the tumour-to-spleen ratio (TSR) was < 0.71 or the signal intensity index (SII) was > 16.5%. ","[['racterized when the tumour-to-spleen ratio (TS', 'tumour', 'Diseases']]","[[52, 58, 'tumour', 'DS']]"
PMC6032655,UNK,"Because of too little fat, fat-invisible AML was defined having a TSR ≥ 0.71 and a SII ≤ 16.5% [910]. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"This classification showed an almost perfect inter-reader agreement, which means it is feasible for radiologists to apply in practice. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"However, it is important to understand that detection of the most hypodense area on CT or most signal-dropped area on MRI and placement of the ROI within is crucial. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"A mislocation or inappropriate size of the ROI may change the type of AML, with misclassification and unwanted procedures as a result. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Another disadvantage is the fact that different CT and MR scanners may produce different attenuation numbers and signal intensities, leading to a wrong classification. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"For example, if an AML is measured –9 HU at one CT scanner, it will be classified as fat-poor. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"However, if another scanner describes the lesion as –11 HU, it will be classified as fat-rich. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Although the difference of 2 HU is very minimal and probably insignificant, the management is completely different [910]. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Another review article proposed a classification based on clinical, histologic, and imaging features. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"First, the authors divided renal AMLs into sporadic and hereditary. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Histologically, they classified sporadic AMLs into benign triphasic type and potentially malignant epithelioid type [34]. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,Benign triphasic type was further divided into fat-rich and fat-poor AML using imaging modalities. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"While fat-rich AML contained enough fat to be detected on UECT (ROI ≤ –10 HU), fat-poor AML did not. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Fat-poor AML was further classified into three subtypes, based on the amount and distribution of adipocytes within the lesion and other imaging features: hyperattenuating AML, isoattenuating AML, and AML with epithelial cysts. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Hyperattenuating AML was hyperattenuating compared to renal parenchyma on UECT (> 45 HU), homogeneously enhancing on contrast enhanced CT, and T2-hypointense on MRI. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"On the contrary, isoattenuating AML was characterized by attenuation numbers close to renal parenchyma on UECT (between –10 and 45 HU). ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"These lower attenuation levels were caused by the presence of fat cells, sufficient in quantity to lower the overall attenuation relative to hyperattenuating AMLs, but too few in one area to be detected on regular imaging. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Finally, AMLs with epithelial cysts could be distinguished by the presence of epithelial cysts, with the non-cystic parts appearing similar to hyperattenuating AML. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Radiological features of this rare subtype could not be fully described, due to the lack of data [34]. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Epithelioid AMLs, that can be potentially malignant and metastasize, showed hyperattenuation on UECT, heterogeneously enhancement on contrast enhanced CT, and T2-hypointensity on MRI. ","[['ially malignant and metastasize, showed hyperattenu', 'metastasize', 'Diseases']]","[[56, 67, 'metastasize', 'DS']]"
PMC6032655,UNK,These findings were caused by the epithelioid muscle component and the intratumoral haemorrhage and necrosis [3410]. ,"[['nd the intratumoral haemorrhage and necrosis [3410]', 'haemorrhage', 'Diseases']]","[[84, 95, 'haemorrhage', 'DS']]"
PMC6032655,UNK,There are limitations associated with the classification described above. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"First, the requirement of clinical and pathological information makes it difficult for radiologists to use in daily practice. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Second, there are problems in applying the imaging criteria for classifying isoattenuating AML. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,The authors reported isoattenuating AML being an AML with attenuation values between –10 and 45 HU on UECT. ,,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"However, simple renal cysts have attenuation numbers ranging between –10 and 10 and appear definitely hypoattenuating, while renal masses measuring > 40 HU frequently appear hyperattenuating. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"So, because of the wide range of AML attenuation values, “isoattenuating AML” does not seem to be an appropriate term. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Furthermore, the authors did not suggest a quantitative threshold for CSI-MRI, which means that radiologists cannot classify AML using TSR or SII [9]. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"In conclusion, the classification first described is the most easily applicable in practice. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"Radiologists can categorize renal AMLs as fat-rich, fat-poor, and fat-invisible, according to the amount of fat detected on UECT or CSI-MRI. ",,[]
PMC6032655,UNK,"However, attention should be paid to fit the ROI within the right area of the fat tissue, otherwise many fat-rich or fat-poor AMLs may be misclassified as fat-poor or fat-invisible. ",,[]

PMC6032655,RESULTS,AML accounted for nearly half of this group of benign masses. ,,[]
PMC6032655,RESULTS,This shows that the differentiation between AML and RCC remains difficult in routine practice [202122]. ,,[]
PMC6032655,RESULTS,"As already repeatedly stated above, classic AML can be distinguished from RCC by the presence of macroscopic fat in sufficient quantity to be detected on UECT. ",,[]
PMC6032655,RESULTS,"However, in 4–5% of AML cases, no fat can be visualized on CT, increasing the difficulty in differentiating it from RCC. ",,[]
PMC6032655,RESULTS,Correctly diagnosing this fat-poor and fat-invisible AML requires sufficient clinical and imaging information. ,,[]
PMC6032655,RESULTS,"Clinical information supporting a diagnosis of AML includes a younger age, female sex, and asymptomatic presentation. ",,[]
PMC6032655,RESULTS,"Imaging findings that should raise the suspicion of AML include the absence of calcification, the absence of perinephric collateral vessels, multiple lesions, hyperattenuation in comparison to renal parenchyma on UECT, and hypointensity on T2-weighted MRI. ",,[]

PMC4808240,INTRO,The field of eHealth is expanding the potential of contemporary medicine [1]. ,,[]

PMC4808240,INTRO,"Current cardiovascular risk management programs in primary care will become too expensive and, although they are highly effective in research settings [4-6], their effectiveness is markedly lower in daily life [7]. ",,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,This evidence-practice gap has several causes [8]. ,,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,"Adherence to life-long lifestyle and medication regimens is a serious challenge, illustrated by long-term adherence rates in chronic diseases that average as low as 50% [9,10].

PMC4808240,INTRO,This renders Web-based interventions potentially powerful and scalable tools to enhance sustained adherence in cardiovascular risk management [12]. ,,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,Older people form an important target population because cardiovascular risk reduction appears effective until old age [13-16]. ,,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,"In 2012, 42% of European people aged between 55 and 74 years used the Internet and this number is increasing [17]. ",,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,Meta-analyses showed that Web-based interventions targeting single cardiovascular risk factors can induce improvements in adult populations [18-21]. ,,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,"However, optimal cardiovascular prevention and risk management practice, as affirmed by the European Society of Cardiology [22] and the American Heart Association [23], requires targeting the complete cardiovascular risk profile. ",,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,"This is particularly applicable for older people, who often have multiple risk factors or already suffered a cardiovascular event. ",,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,A comprehensive approach would increase the value of Web-based interventions for daily practice. ,,[]
PMC4808240,INTRO,"Currently, little is known about the effectiveness of Web-based interventions in older people. ",,[]

PMC4808240,DISCUSS,Our results do not show a beneficial effect of Web-based interventions on incident cardiovascular disease. ,"[['f Web-based interventions on incident cardiovascular disease. ', 'cardiovascular disease', 'Diseases']]","[[83, 105, 'cardiovascular disease', 'DS']]"
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Although the declining effect over time could play a role, more likely explanations for these findings are the limited follow-up time of the studies to detect these outcomes (mean length of the studies was 13 months) and the fact that these outcomes were not the primary focus of these studies. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Because of the latter, data collection may not have been systematic and adjudication of the data by an independent committee may be lacking. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Therefore, we cannot draw strong conclusions from these findings. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,The results of this study should be interpreted with caution because of several limitations. ,,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"The methodological quality of the studies was fair, but none of the studies was double blind, rendering them prone to performance bias. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Only 20 studies had a blinded outcome assessment, so detection bias may also be present. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Because the sensitivity analyses for the risk-of-bias assessment did not reveal significant differences between the low risk and unknown/high risk-of-bias subgroups, except for the domain of random sequence generation, we think that our findings have not been largely affected by these potential sources of bias. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Another limitation is the substantial heterogeneity in several of the meta-analyses that is, in part, explained by two effect modifiers: study duration and intervention type. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Patient groups with a higher burden have a larger window of opportunity for improvement potentially resulting in larger intervention effects [88], which could also have contributed to heterogeneity. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"We could not draw firm conclusions on the difference between primary and secondary prevention, because only four studies on secondary prevention were included in this analysis. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Last, there is a potential for publication bias and small study bias. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,Most of the studies with small sample sizes reported large effects and similar studies with null findings did not appear in the funnel plots (Multimedia Appendix 5). ,,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Strengths of our study are the comprehensive search strategy, the quantitative meta-analysis, and the assessment of the effect of Web-based interventions for all cardiovascular risk factors using both intermediate and clinical outcomes. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,Our search strategy was comprehensive because we used a broad definition of Web-based interventions and only excluded telemedicine and mobile phone interventions. ,,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,It was not always possible to set Web-based interventions apart from telemedicine and mobile phone interventions. ,,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"As long as the Web-based program was the main component of the intervention, we judged the study eligible for our systematic review. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"By pooling the effect sizes on all different cardiovascular risk factors, we aimed to assess the overall effect of an Internet-based approach for people with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. ","[['ach for people with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. ', 'cardiovascular disease', 'Diseases']]","[[176, 198, 'cardiovascular disease', 'DS']]"
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,This approach provides insight into the overall potential of Internet-based interventions in this field. ,,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Although basic computer literacy as an inclusion criterion probably led to selection of participants with a relatively high socioeconomic status, several studies included in the meta-analysis focused on people from medically underserved areas. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Therefore, the external validity of the results might be acceptable and may be generalizable to middle-aged to older primary care populations with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. ","[['populations with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. ', 'cardiovascular disease', 'Diseases']]","[[168, 190, 'cardiovascular disease', 'DS']]"
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Our results show that Web-based interventions can be effective in improving the cardiovascular risk factor profile of middle-aged and older people, but effects are modest and can only have clinical relevance on the population level if sustained over time. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Considering the current interest and focus on eHealth by policy makers, funding agencies, and a myriad of research and patient organizations [89,90], it is important to evaluate the actual evidence base objectively. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"Unrealistic expectations of the effectiveness of Web-based interventions obscure the true challenges that have to be overcome first, including testing interventions that were designed specifically for older people, improving methodological robustness of studies, and improving sustainability of effects. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"On the macro level, trials can assess sustainability by prolonging follow-up, recording clinical events, and measuring surrogate cardiovascular outcomes (eg, BP, cholesterol levels, and weight) at multiple time points (eg, at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months). ","[['r outcomes (eg, BP, cholesterol levels, and weight)', 'cholesterol', 'Chemicals']]","[[162, 173, 'cholesterol', 'CD']]"
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,"On the micro level, adherence should be evaluated by studying intervention usage through time with standardized evaluation methods. ",,[]
PMC4808240,DISCUSS,Sustainability is of particular importance because long-term effects are required for primary and secondary prevention to truly contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. ,"[['truly contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
